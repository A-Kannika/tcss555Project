Hi...It's a beautiful day in sunny AZ. Just got though the heat of the summer. I have lived here for almost 6 years, and just love it, the sun shines almost every day and its warm. It's Wednesday and I have the day off since I worked this last Sunday. I just joined this site and hope to reconnect with friends from the past and make new friends. If you remember me send me a message I would love to hear from you..Diane,Tom and Bri on New Years Eve....Aren't they the cutest couple...,Just got back from the White Montain in Arizona. It is 6000 feet up and very cool, nice to get away from the desert heat for a while. I try to get away every year on my birthday. Rented a house on a 19 acre horse ranch. They raise race hourses. Enjoyed the break from work and the normal day to day.
