Black hands held so high/The vulture wheels and dives/Something on the thermals/Yanked his chain/Smelled your boring apex/Rotting on the train tracks/He laughed under his breath/Because you thought that you could outrun sorrow/Take your own advice/Thunder,The deeper I dig this mine/the walls will begin to shine/and nothing will ever leave this room/Oh, and when nothing I find/I will be the first to die. --Annuals,I have internet!,Vegan pierogies! <3 <3,I hate migraines.,Time for a run, then food of some sort, and then I must brave the post office.
