Helped move my youngest son Conner into his dorm room at LSU today.  First day of daycare, first day of kindergarten, first day of college..........they all feel about the same.,I took the \See What SEC Team You Are\ test. To the questions, what are your favorite colors and what animal are you I put the \right\ answers. The results showed me as being some stupid school east of Louisiana which I won't even name.  I guess I didn't ,I have found a way to lose 10 pds. in three days - stomach flu.  Warning: I am \over it\ but right now it seems like food will never appeal to me ever again the rest of my life.,The view from the hammock,I am often surprised at what I see when I truly look.,I believe at the very core of my being that LSU will defeat Alabama in 10 days if they score more points than the Crimson Tide does.,Woke up to snow and ice covered roads here in Shreveport.  If I was a 14 yr. old kid back in Winnfield in the late 1960s I would be heading over to Thrill Hill. There I would meet up with Buddy Heard
