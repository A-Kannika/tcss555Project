Good morning world. Or at least the section that my facebook friends cover.,I think I am the only person not going to Warped tomorrow.,There's just no way that we can win, that was a masterpiece.,I'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, but my feet are gone.,So here I am, minding my own business and breaking a Hungarian Half-Breed when a cougar decides to come and fuck my shit up. This is not the last you'll hear from John Marston you fucking jungle cat asshole.,Garlic bread is the shit.,\Mom, can I stay home from school tomorrow?\\
\"...no?\"\
\"Isn't Catherine skipping school tomorrow to go to a concert or something? Plus she's already stayed home like three times.\"\
\"No she hasn't.\"\
\"...\"\
\"Soooo can I stay home?\"\
\"No.\"\
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,Too many pup pup pup pup pup pup puppies,I want to play Conker's Bad Fur Day right now.,Alright, whatever.,Am I the only person that isn't excited for prom/doesn't know or care what the mistletoe ball is?,Man, I love pierogies.,Man. I fucking love almonds"
