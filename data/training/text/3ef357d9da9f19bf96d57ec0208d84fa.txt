We have to prove That our love is real over and over again But let them think what they want I know it will never end Because I know where it began And my heart still heart still pounds twice as fast Whenever you walk by Cause I still love you,To die is to know that you're alive And my river of blood won't run dry I never wanted to lose you, no But a cold heart is a dead heart And it feels like I've been buried alive by love,I feel For her!,yay airing out our problems on facebook how original !!,All is lost in this war And all we can do is to wail and weep to the saddest song Sleepwalking past hope I unlit the light to embrace the dark To be near but not to turn into you my darling Forever we're lost in our souls' storm Reflections of each other',Despair has a face And all these wounds remain unhealed Blessed to kill and enslaved Are all hearts around love's will Thrilled to start all over again Crawl down dead lover's lane, The maze of memories stained And suck the blood right out of my heart Fea,my  poem..
