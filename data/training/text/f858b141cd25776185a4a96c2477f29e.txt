ugh...I really need to sort myself out...I look a mess.,I give up......it's not worth being under discrimination for, and besides I was only screwing around to begin with. So that's it...I give up, I'm no longer bisexual in preference. So all the dickhead screwballs out there have no reason to mock me, no in fact they have no reason to go anywhere near me.,Heh, I try hard everyday to put up with the nonsense people give me in school. Cut me some slack you pretentious bunch of ass kissing groupies. I swear you guys give in to peer pressure just because you have nothing else to do. I'm not going to just stand around taking your crap, so either give it a rest or go pester somebody else...,Life is like a photo... We develop from the negatives...,I always fuck up, one way or another...,I couldn't be any happier with life as it is now :),A hole where part of my mind should be. I am broken, A broken man. I was once an innocent soul but one can only take so much torment until they break, letting shreds of sanity fly
