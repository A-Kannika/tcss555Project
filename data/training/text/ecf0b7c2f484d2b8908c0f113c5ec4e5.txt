Studing for mid-term in 2 hours. I would say that I only have to study the things that I don't know, but since I missed a lot of the class, don't have the book, and not sure if I can use a reference sheet (yeah you call it a cheat sheet), it looks like I have to go through everything.,Making myself a turkey right now. The ham I made two weeks ago turned out great and I am expecting the same results w/ this turkey.,I am online, when suddenly I say \oh SHIT\. Tuesday night is forcasted 8-9 inches of snow...I have to bike through that. Well atleast I got a new bike that is safe to ride on the streets.,Just looked at my schedule for finals, and is liking the fact I don't have any 8:00am finals. This means that I won't be sleeping though half of my final.,Thanksgiving was amazing, it was nice to try something different. I had a good time.,Thanks everyone for the Birthday greeting. You are all the best : ),Glad that Software Engineerers will be getting newer elective classes at MSOE next school year to choose from.
