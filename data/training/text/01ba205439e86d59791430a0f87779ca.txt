What happened to the me that woke up every morning with a smile on my face and a bright outlook on the day? the me that was never sad,Get caught in the race \
Of this crazy life \
Trying to be everything can make you lose your mind \
I just wanna go back in time \
To American honey, yea \
\
There's a wild, wild whisper \
Blowing in the wind \
Calling out my name like a long lost friend \
Oh I miss those days as the years go by \
Oh nothing's sweeter than summer time \
