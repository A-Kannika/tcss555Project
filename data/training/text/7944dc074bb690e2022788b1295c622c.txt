4 hours and 44 minutes of daylight today. yay!,9 degrees in Squarebanks. Winter's in the air. (But it might be 35 tomorrow!),Jump in bed and cover up your head cause Santa Claus comes tonight!,I'd like to help you all out with game requests but I haven't played any games and don't have the patience to try right now.  Or maybe I don't have the smarts. Sorry!,I like it on a hook in the hallway.,Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,\
The flying cloud, the frosty light;\
The year is dying in the night;\
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.\

--Alfred, Lord Tennyson,-40 in Fairbanks tonight.  For all of you who have left and wonder if you're missing anything........,And so, as Tiny Tim said, \"A Merry Christmas to us all; God bless us, every one!\""
