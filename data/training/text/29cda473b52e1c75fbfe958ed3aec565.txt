Hoping for zero tornadoes today and looking forward to Saturday: grad. party for a HS friend I haven't seen in YEARS and date night with hubby!!!!,Buddy doing better- might be able to go to my dance lesson after all!! :D *crosses fingers and toes* Also thinking I might go ahead and get my hair chopped off soon! Locks of Love can just sell if it's too short anyway. ;),He sweats buckets playing the new Punch Out on Wii and for some reason he has to come show me?!,Just ordered my first pair of ghillies!!!!!,Am thinking that since I don't feel like throwing three different clothing swap parties to accommodate the different styles, ages and sizes of my variety of friends, and it would be too chaotic to do one big one, that maybe I'll do an accessory swap party,Nothing gets you up early like severe thunderstorms. 8|,Boredom cured :P,Why am I bored when I can think of at least a dozen things I could be doing right now besides sitting at the computer being bored? :/,Time to get off my butt and get ready for the day.,
