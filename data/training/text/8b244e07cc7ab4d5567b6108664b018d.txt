Had a wonderful weekend with the one I love the most.,If you are reading this, even if we don't speak often, please post a comment of a memory of you and me. When you're finished, post this paragraph on your own status; you will be surprised what people remember about you... be nice!! LOL!!,Thanks everyone for my Birthday wishes!!!! I have enjoyed my extended Birthday weekend. Can't wait to party again in Richmond soon....,For all of you who are wondering.  Last week, after 10 years, I finally decided to go back to my maiden name \Rintamaki\.  This is not a riddle, I'm no secret agent, this is not a test.  I'm still the same old Amy, I just went back to my roots.
