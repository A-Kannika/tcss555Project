Naunsa man ko guys uie....why am i loss from my body and my soul is wondering in this wasted world...why am i searching for another one....no, not searching but confuse if who would i chose the girl that loves me and has an intimate relationship with me even we dont have time to meet, or the girl that is with me all the time and makes my lonely days without the other one complete....help me my friends...,Take a second out to think about this: in your life you search and search for the right person for you. Every time you break up with someone you get one step closer to that person. You should look at moving on as getting closer to meeting the one.,would never love AGAIN....promise!....but if the time is right and the girl of my dreams(a girl that has no intention of hurting me) would knock to my empty heart that needs someone to fill it, then thats the time i will experience love for the last time. And it should be what i expected, if not maybe i would die.,You know you love someone when you want them to be h
