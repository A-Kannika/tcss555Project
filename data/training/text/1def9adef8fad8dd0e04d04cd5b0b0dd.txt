To be loved is a Success. To love is a Duty.\
To be with someone you love is an Achievement.\
To be with someone who loves you is LIFE.,Don't judge me until you have lived my life and have experienced all the things I have gone through. Then you can make your decision about what you think of me.,Missing you is easy. It's waiting to see you again that's hard.,The greatest achievement in life is to stand up again after falling.,I put on a mask, I hide the pain. I force a smile, I shove the sadness away. I walk around on the outside, while I die on the inside.,\"There might be some hours of loneliness. But there was something wonderful even in loneliness. At least you belonged to yourself when you were lonely.\""
