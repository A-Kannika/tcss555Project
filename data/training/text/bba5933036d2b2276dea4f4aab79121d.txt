Does anyone watch \American Idol\ anymore?  Where did these people come from this year!?  I've never seen such wall-to-wall talent.  At least seven of the guys from tonight are better than anyone from last year, and at least three are better than Adam Lambert.  James, Jacob...and Casey!  My GOD!,Oh, boy...I got my first spam text message today.  What is the world coming to?
