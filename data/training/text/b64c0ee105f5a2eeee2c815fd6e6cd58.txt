at the folks house...,It has been a sad day....I mean I'm not crying my eyes out here over farrah fawcett and micheal jackson. But come on...its still sad. They died.,there comes a point in your life where you gotta make your own choices. Based on your heart and what God is telling you to do. And dont worry about other peoples opinions...God's will is what counts.,is about to be off to the hospital! Cant wait till baby Kian Joshua is here!!!!,Happy 4th of July!!! Be safe today! And have some fun! :),There's no God like Jehovah!,\ He is jealous for me. Loves like a hurricane. I am a tree bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy. When all of a sudden I am unaware of the afflictions. Eclipsed by His glory and realize just how beautiful You are. And how great Your affections,is about to leave for the dude ranch. This year i know its gonna be better! I cant wait!!!!!,is enjoying time with my cousins that I missed oh so much...and thinking how guys are so funny...they just dont get it.,its off to work I go.
