Oh, Oh, Oh can't turn around. He never failed me yet!\ \Yes, I started with Jesus and I am going through.\   Yes, I went to one of those ol school Reviva,I am back in town and in rare form!  I got vaseline on my spiritual face, spiritual nikes, some cut your face all up rings on, hair pulled back in a pony tail, some spiritual straight leg jeans and my earrings off!!
