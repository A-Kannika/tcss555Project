To my classmates and friends of West High Class of 1964 - here are two pictures from last weekend's reunion, the first is Saturday, October 10 and the second is Friday, October 9.  Thanks to all who attended and best wishes to those who could not make it.,Due Date is a very funny movie and Hibatchi Sushi Grill is a very good place to eat!!,I think that BABY video is some kind of virus - I did not send it to anyone and I would advise EVERYONE not to try to open it.  It got me kicked off FaceBook until I was able to identify my friends!  That was trippy!,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoFYV8IOtR4,Saw 3 movies this weekend.  The Rite & Black Swan & The King's Speech.  I would only recommend The King's Speech!,To the class of 1964 facebook friends, last night I got an e-mail from Bruce Dugstad, who told me that Layten Heckman died earlier this month.  I am sure you all remember Layten.  Remember when he mimeographed his Spanish assignments in the West Junior office and sold them for a nickel apiece!
