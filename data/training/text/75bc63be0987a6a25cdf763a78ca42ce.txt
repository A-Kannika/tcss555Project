facebook sucks again... another shity virus.. sorry for those \infected\ by my poor judgement of \touching\ something so annoying,Funeral\

I was feeling how my shoes rubbed the sidewalk,\

Voices undefined.\
Wind was washing dusty places,\
Of forgotten fears.\
Steps were slower without spaces,\
Bloody smears.\
Timeless hopes and broken glasses,\
Fill my ways.\
Absentminded body passes,\
Mirror gaze.\
Flowers, whispers, tears above,\
Heavy dress of mud.\
Reckoning the hate and love,\

WHY!!!! :((...... :)),Truth constitutes sense not flavors of personal feeli"
