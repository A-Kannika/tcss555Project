last day sa isabel.... huhuhu... doing back to miami tomorrow... bye2 pipz!,life has been so cruel to me?!... huhuhuuhuuhu.,\He's tolerable but not enough to tempt me!\ pride and prejudice tagline.,Why does everytime i feel so right, it seemed so wrong? Why does everytime i get tired i keep on working on? Why does everytime i make a promise, i keep on breaking it? Why does everytime i'm hurt, i keep on laughing? Why does everytime i feel like crying, i hurt the feelings of others by cracking jokes on them? Why is it so hard to act normally when you're in a state of nothingness?,wala jud... boring-boring guid sang life ari subong! wahahaha, karay-a takon! jeez!,Sometimes there are things in our lives we must let go of... maybe we have loved it but it's just not meant for us! Just keep in mind that we are rational beings, when we feel it's too much, learn to make the right and wise choices even if it meant a broken heart!,Don't let me repeat the same mistake i did before. I'm trying my best to get rid of you bu
