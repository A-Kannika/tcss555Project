poof,I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to blame...,Of sagas and longtales...,and we're lost in this masquerade...,We try to talk it over but, the words get in the way...,Love will tear us apart, again...,Running over the same old ground., What have we found?  The same old fears.  Wish you were here...,I STILL can't get my tickets done... somehow doing it will make leaving more real...,O that some minstrel's harp were near To utter notes of gladness And chase this silence from the air, That fills my heart with sadness!,and here we go now...,We used to be so free, We were living for the love we had and Living not for reality...,How do you pack four years of your life into four tiny suitcases?,This goodbye is gonna be even harder than leaving BBSR :(,Miss Manipal...,we are all just prisoners here, of our own device...,'Moving on' is a damn stupid concept...,Anamol got through L&T!!!,Ni Woofer main teri, teri Tu mera Amplifier, fier...,if only...,Love will tear us apart... again.,Thank you, al
