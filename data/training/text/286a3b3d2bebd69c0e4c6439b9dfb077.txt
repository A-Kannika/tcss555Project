I still love this picture from 8th grade!,is exhausted and soooo freaking excited that we will be performing for an audience tommorow!!!!!,is stuck between volleyball and theater.....,might be going to the asylum...if she knew what was going on,feels like strinking was a good resolution to the show.,? Keep your hand at the level of your eye ?,is going to break down and cry if her days don't get any more interesting.,wants to do musical theater. All she needs to learn now is how to sing, dance and act. Easy right?,thinks her head might explode from sightreading...,has been jumping around her house all day....!!!!!,I can't think of anything to say but OPENING NIGHT!!!,just listened to The Phantom of the Opera soundtrack and freaking fell in love with \Stranger Than Your Dreamt.\,just got done: 1. watching Phantom of the Opera first time 2. crying. :( Poor Phantom,It's weird that I'm just as exhausted as after late shows....,wishes she could do this for a living.,is going to throw a tantrum if I have to stay in
