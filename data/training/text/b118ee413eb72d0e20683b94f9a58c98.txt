This broken heart will never heal, so I curse it forever, you know why??? Because I've had enough of hurting so much about something I know I'll never changed,I wonder if I told him would things be different between us, would he look at me and see me the way I want.,I shouldn't really get my hopes up, but I never know what can happen, these days who knows,Things are looking better for this little broken heart of mine I'm so happy now I've found this guy,HAPPY NEW YEAR to all of my friends and family and may everyone I know have everything they want for the new year.,Woooooo the new year is here lol, hope it was good for all.,Strange how life can be weird, but these days who cares, life it full and don't care what people think about, I LOVE MY LIFE. My 18th soon wooooo lol,I don't care what people think anymore, do what you like I ain't going to stop you whether it be good or bad, I love my life to much for people to mess it up. DO WHAT YOU LIKE. I LOVE MY LIFE.,Living my life the way I want to and I love it,
