I am trying to get to sleep, but it is so hot and stuffy so I have to keep the fan on. Sadly, the ceiling fan makes noise. This would be ok if the noise didn't sound like little rodents scurrying around the room. Pretty sure it is the fan,I'm going to Sea World today.,I did watch it. And then I watched it several more times. It was awesome.
