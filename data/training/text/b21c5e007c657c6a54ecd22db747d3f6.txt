Ive been kicked down. a while of silence and still cant turn things around. I try to show the fact that I have no fear yet I wake up at night with nothing but my own screams to hear. night after night, nightmare after nightmare, no matter what I do, the world shouldnt care. if I was afraid to jump in this time... it doesnt mean Ive let the world down... this time, I just couldnt save her...,0.0.  i fell asleep and woke up this morning... and then went back to bed and woke up at 1.  i fell asleep yesterday at 6 in the afternoon. i think i needed a break from work lol.,You make me smile like the sun, fall outta bed, Sing like a bird, Dizzy in my head.
