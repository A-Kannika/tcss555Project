Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep... wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, the one who turns to his friends and says, thats her...    ...,Sometimes I wish I were a kid again, skinned knees are alot easier to fix than a broken heart.,Nothing hurts more than realizing he meant everything to you, but you meant nothing to him.,Now I’m in our secret place Alone in your embrace Where all my wrongs have been erased You have forgiven,Heart broken 2 times in less than 2 weeks. I still have six days left till the two week mark...Shall I try for 3 times???,If I told you I loved you what would you do? What would you say back? Would you stare blankly at me with your eyes glazed over and drool dripping from you mouth or would you yell 'I love you too!'
