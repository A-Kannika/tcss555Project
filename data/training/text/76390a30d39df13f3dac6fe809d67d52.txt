PC has died. Stay tuned, be back in a few months ?,Checking in, saying hello and hope to be with you all in a few months or so... Karli... Daddy loves you baby !!!!,Checking in and back out. Not much time for computing ATM but I send all friends and family my love. Karli ... Daddy loves you baby. :),Back to work ...,Welcome old friends. I don't chat much on here. This is more for family. It is good to see your faces. I'll be in school all of next week. I hope you are all doing well...,Thinking I should take the time to upload pics. NAH !!!!,FB is taking matters into its own hands again...Wonder why you only see status updates from the same people?? FB has changed its News Feed so that by default you can only see updates from people with whom you have recently interacted! To change this click \most recent\ then \edit options\ and tick the box to receive updates from ALL friends. Repost this!! Remember only a few of your friends will actually see it,Looks as if I'll be home alone and bored out of my mind tonigh
