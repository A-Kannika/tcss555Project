yahuh!!! wanna go to work na...,mamere's trying to catch some sleep...me, just surfing the net..enjoying my vacant time...yahuh!!!,ukay-ukay!!!,singing: amazing grace how sweet the sound..that saved a wretch like me. i once was lost but now am found..was blind but now i see... oh love this song..thank you Lord for your grace..thank you for giving me freedom from all bondages..yahuh! so great to be in God's presence...nothing and no one compares to You Lord...Your dwelling place is the place i'd rather be in my whole life...love you Lord...,FOR FROM HIM AND THROUGH HIM AND TO HIM ARE ALL THINGS. TO HIM BE THE GLORY FOREVER! AMEN.,for the wages of sin is death...,a loved one just passed away...it's painful. a lot of questions are popping in my head, tempting me to question God. but no...instead of asking why, i'd rather ask how will i accept the situation, how will i comfort my family and so many hows. i know God, my comforter, my refuge, will be there for me and for my family so i will be still. forever i will
