Are you a lover or a fighter? Cuz I need a bit of both...\
A Lover ain't worth nothing if he won't fight to keep you close...,We only see two things in people; what we want to see and what they choose to show us. No matter how close two people are, an infinite distance always lays between them...,I told him \"nothing lasts forever...\"\
He said, \"well we aren't nothing\"  <3"
