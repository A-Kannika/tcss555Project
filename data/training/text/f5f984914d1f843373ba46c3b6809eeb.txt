Just got back from TheMiddleOfNowhere, Iowa. And now I have to draw Buddy Holly for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Spirit Lake in Okoboji. Yay, 10 drawings at a time D:,Volunteering at my mom's work...Working with little autistic children (ages 2-5) They're so cute, I love them :),Just got back from Marina's cabin. Got seriously bruised up while we were tubing (but we got some serious air. ha!) Now if you excuse me, I'm going to go saw off my foot.,Going down to Iowa, gonna disappear for a week...,I'm so scared of growing up, growing old....Mortality, losing all that I've got at the present. We go day by day, baby steps. We don't even notice when one day we're making little crafts in elementary school and the next we're in high school. Time goes so,my mom keeps on logging onto my account to play the games. Just saying so it doesn't seem like I'm good at pool, haha,Going to see Harry Potter :) Looking forward to the excessive use of filters :P,needs people to buy my drawings so I can get out of America and
