watching house,back home,you never know what you got till its gone..........,knees back and feet hurting.....ugh....make it stop,watching NCIS,Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before, how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way, and that so many things that one goes worrying about are of no importance whatsoever...,Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do.

Discover.\,so tired of all this crap....GROW UP AND QUIT BEING A THREE YEAR OLD.....,just got done bowling....had a blast,worried about sable,Wondering what's gotten into our senior guys minds....Use your brains guys date people your own age!!!!!,just got off work.....,in atlanta go to mediation tomorrow wish us luck.....,HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO EVERYONE!!!!!!!!,finally have my braces off!!!!,.....,just got off of work,over at mickey's,India Foxtrot
