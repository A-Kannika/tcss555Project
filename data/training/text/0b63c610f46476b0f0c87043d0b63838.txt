Live the life to the max today.,Dear Students I have attached the exam dates as mail on aims group please check,I WISH ALL MY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY  & PHYSIOTHERAPY STUDENTS GOOD LUCK FOR THEIR UNIVERSITY EXAMS.,Life is book written by an idiot but its fun reading it,The act of taking the first step is what separates the winners from the losers.,THREE DAYS OF CHILLING IN MANIPAL AND @ MORE DAYS IN COCHIN,A clear vision, backed by definite plans, gives you a tremendous feeling of\
confidence and personal power.,Motivation alone is not enough. If you have an idiot and you motivate him,\
