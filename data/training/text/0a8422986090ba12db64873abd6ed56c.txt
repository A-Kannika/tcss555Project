Just finished taking my teenage nephews shopping...They are so much easier to shop with than my teenage daughter.  I wonder why..,People change when the pain is greater than the fear of change.,I am thankful for my for my family, friends, health, and new job and especially for all the trials this year which has made me stronger and closer to my Creator.,Shopping and playing cards great Saturday,Someone told me recently to have my protein shake after I excersize instead of before. So I tried it today after I excersize  but now I am physically exhausted & I need a nap even though I just had protein. What did I do wrong?,I luv just living 10 min from my daughter's school instead of 60 min. I wonder what I am I going to do with the extra time of being my daughter's cab. I know-converse with God more--more peace & joy,My baby girl turns 15 today. Where did the years go? I remember how terrified I was about being a mother and now it has been my greatest accomplishment as I watch her turn into a young lady. Thank yo
