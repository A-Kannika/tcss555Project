Sometime people are nothing...We make them something and when they become everything in our life..They feel that we are nothing..,Love without a Pain isn't Really Romance...,Dil keh raha hai tumse, wada karo tum humse, chahe tum jahan bhi ..jaana jana.. meri yaad rakhna...meri yaad rakhna..!!,Find arms that will hold you at ur weakest,eyes that will see you at ur ugliest,heart that will love at u worst ,if u have found it, you have found love.,People says love is blind..you don't realize it what you are doing in love...however...I say....if you realize it what are you doing...you cannot do anything for your love... Just do it ,the best possible way for your love to make him/her happy and give a special moment to them..,People come and go from our LIFE..but their FOOTPRINTS wil remain on our HEART FOREVER..!!!!,Don't judge me by what you have seen in me,Remember\What you have seen in me is only what I have chosen to show you\\
