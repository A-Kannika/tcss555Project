my kids may not change the world, they may not even do the right things. But my kids are all mine and I will love them forever!,Be there when people need you, because in order to have friends you must first be one.,Simple words to live by:  Don't say you can't if you can.  Don't say you do if you don't.  Don't say you will if you won't.,i've carried a child within my body. I've slept with a baby on my chest. I have kissed scrapes and bruises, bn thrown up on, peed on, argued with and spent many sleepless nights worrying, but i wudnt have it any other way. My body isnt magazine perfect, but when i look in the mirror i see a mum & there is no greater honour or blessing. Make this as your status if you are proud to be a mum xXx,Just to say we shouldn't need one day(VALENTINES DAY) To show our love to whom ever we should be doin it everyday!!! Love to all my family friends and facebook peeps.. xxxx
