Worked out for an hour today at the health club then came home and baked Toll House cookies. I think the cookies won.,Back from our cruise. What a Blast!!!!!!! Now it's time to give my liver a rest.,That's right, never sweat the small stuff. Before you know it, the kids are grown and they are not going to have fond memories of a clean house but rather all the things they did in and around the house.,Thank you all for your congrats. Kirstin and Kendall are doing great.,Kirstin is having a girl. She'll be in debt before the baby's born. (shopping, shopping, shopping)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Kenny is Home again.Our family is fully united again......AMEN!,Sent my boys off to college.....It's soooo quiet at home, but not for long.....
