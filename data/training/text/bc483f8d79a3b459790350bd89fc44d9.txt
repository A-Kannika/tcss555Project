See you      in September.  Life is just too short to be spending it on the internet in the Summer.  If you wanna talk to me, just drop in, you know where I live.  See you.  Love you.,Watched the Tornado pass South East out of my 2nd floor window.  Jonathan called me to say he was going to get hit by it while near 400/Rutherford driving home from work.  He survived it, but 6 cars stopped in front of him were thrown about and damaged.  I'm a very greatful Mom tonight!,I had to swerve three times today, because of selfish B###rds talking on their cell phone!!! They were lucky the other lanes were free, or I would have plowed right into the F****s!! Maybe they should try reading and jogging on the 401 next time !!!  We should start a radical movement, honking and flashing our high beams at cell phone drivers!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMAHAIDGAD!!!,Jedz, Pij i bac wesoly!
