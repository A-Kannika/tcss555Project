So I'm sitting in bed unable to sleep (go figure) debating how much this sucks... yet I've no comprehension of how much this must suck for shauna.,About 6 ish hours into the surgery god knows how much longer... it started to storm here. And somehow that's calming and reassuring.,So after coming to the hospital lastnight with shauna it still hasn't quiet hit me what's happend it probly won't till Friday when the surgury is going to happen. But I have come to the determination that hospital eggs taste like crap.,so 2 hours and counting till Shauna's surgery. starting to get a bit nervous. but like I've been told a hundred times. she's in the best hands possible right now.,Work sux I'm still all for illegilization of no one awake before 6am.,Draw in the sand your hurts, But carve in the stone your blessings.,Whohoo waiting blows...,Snow and thunder...wicked,I hate it when u have to be somewhere @ a certain time, not a minute sooner... and ur there like 15 minutes early... that 15 minutes drags by like an hour.,T
