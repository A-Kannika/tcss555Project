Missing my baby.... went to his Daddy's for the rest of the week... I think I'll just go hide in my bedroom and boo hoo for awhile.,Stacia got to go on an all female retreat up at Priest Lake with some good friends this weekend.... :( I didn't go because I didn't have a babysitter for my \little man\. lol. She came home looking like a tornado hit her and knocked her into a mud puddle... but she had a blast!,I'm going to be a Grandma again on Friday!! Another boy... Mariah's going in for surgery at 7:00 a.m.,Sorry it's been so long since I've been on here. My hard drive took a \nose dive\... I installed a new one (1 TB, Whoo Hoo) and hopefully I'll be able to retrieve most of my info off the old one... wish me luck. I had close to 10 GB of pictures that I hadn't backed up yet, like a dumbass.... You'd think I'd learn...... just lazy sometimes,Thanks everyone for the Birthday wishes... it was a good day. Mariah and I took the kids and went to dinner because our b-days are so close together.... it was nice.,sorr
