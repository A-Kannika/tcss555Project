Still awake after staying up three nights in a row. Just finished playing a game with one of my best friends. Texting people in bed while waiting for the restful blanket of sleep to envelop me. And we get our kittens tomorrow(today actually),Looking forward to going to sleep in a few minutes. First week of the second semester was fun, much less stress than last semester. Must finish this movie first though :'(,I despise my complete lack of INT and WIS when i'm sick. Apparently gave away my gas discount receipt to Christian Nettel instead of the receipt needed to get my Fable 3 for me. Awesome.,What to do, what to do...,Irritated at the lack of response i'm getting via text messages. Everyone must be busy or something lol.,Will be so happy to get out of high school. Looking forward to college and life outside of a boxed-in closed campus, and to spending more time with my friends and family.,Home with just the kitties, waiting for a response from a friend. About to go to sleep.,Playing City of Heroes with Flor.
