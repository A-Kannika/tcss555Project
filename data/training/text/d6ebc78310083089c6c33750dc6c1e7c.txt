I'm so sleepy,I guess I truly understand that it wont work. I think deep down inside I always new that it wouldn't. You came into my life in such a whirlwind, bringing such joy. I hate to see you go. I hate to be alone and have to deal with the reality of life again with no one there behind me. I hope that someone will love you one day as much as I do, I know that I hope that someone will love me as much as you did.,I HATE THE SNOW,Im all in, this monday i begin to seriously take my health into account. I will be hitting the gym and dieting( the right way...I did my homework). I am so tired of being out of shape and over weight. Here I come healthy, watch out!,Hey if anyone needs my number urs8836090,Thank you so much guys, it means a lot.,So , now the catholic church is teaching intolerance... Oh wait, they have always taught  intolerance. It's like the army, \ dint ask don't tell.\ I wonder if any of the diocese gay priests would be offended by this decision. Not that they would ever speak up about it. Nice
