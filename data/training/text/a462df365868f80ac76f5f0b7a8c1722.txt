Worried for my sister.  Cancer is an ugly thing.,I'm carb deprived! Wahhhh!,Nothing is going right.,My kitchen is missing an L shaped piece of countertop and sink. It's closed off with thick plastic, and the air scrubbers and dryers are running.  Dad's supposed to coming to visit over Thanksgiving.,Worried about Kiska.,I had a nice little ride tonight. Lady did everything I asked, even cantered on command, instead of acting like a stubborn mule.,Hoping to hear good news about Dad.,Santa Ana winds are blowing hard tonight. I'm quite ready for them to stop now.,I am hungry. I want something tasty.  A little good company would be nice, too.,I believe I have recovered from Friday night.,Success! I have uninstalled the old dishwasher and after everything dries up, (The reason for having to remove it in the first place), I can install the new one.,Today I learned that a very special person has left us, and transitioned home. I am forever grateful that our paths crossed. It has made me a better person.  Au revoir Mo
