... just wondering. Why am I seeing Pokémons on people's proflie pictures? Is there some sort of national day people do so?,... the bRuins couldn't beat a team from the much maligned Atlantic Coast Conference and win the Emerald Bowl. They won't be beating a Big East dropout Temple in chilly Washington D.C. either. U-C-L-A SUCKS!!!!! Always, for all eternity.,... ucla is the reason Oregon State and Cal lost and ruining the Pac-10; last season all out five Pac-10 teams won their respective bowl games, and the bRuins weren't one of them. But then again, Notre Dame declined an invitation after a November collapse and the firing of Charlie Weiss, and Michigan is ineligible for the second straight season... Bring it on Boston College; BEAT THE EAGLES!!!!! And GO TEMPLE!!!,... Temple = epic fail; ucla = SUCKS!!!!!,... I hope it's not going to be the 2002/2003 season all over again, when USC and that other school were the only two out of seven Pac-10 teams to win a bowl game. That was the season USC defeated Iowa at
