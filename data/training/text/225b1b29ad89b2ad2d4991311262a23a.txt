Playing and singing tonight at the \Café du Cerf\ during happy hour (18:15 > 19:30). First gig in my hometown since... 1982!,Had a great time playing the happy hour gig in Café du Cerf. Wasn't so sure about the audience reaction (a few applause but mainly conversations rolling on). Place was packed and at the end the owner of the place gave me a bottle of fine whisky and said I can play anytime. So we settled on a weekly gig. From now on, I'm a friday night \Stickist d'ambiance\ ;-),2 weeks vacation to work on new songs for the next gig at Café du Cerf, next year, friday january 8th. In the meantime: \ Joyeux Noël et bonne année!\,Have been s(t)ick for 3 weeks and had to cancel 2 friday happy hour gigs at the Café du Cerf. Tonight I could play and sing again. Everything was fine. A stickist is back in town (with 3 new songs: Lullaby for Frances by Ian Dury, Louise by Daniel Lanois and Dandy by the Kinks).,Yesterday night's gig was good, with an incredibly loud american woman at the table left of the stage.
