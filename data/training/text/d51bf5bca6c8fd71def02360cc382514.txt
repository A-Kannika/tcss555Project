You got what you want, but it won't get you far Was it what you thought? You forgot who you are  Brian Head Welch - Money lyrics,\I find the answers aren't so clear, Wish I could find a way to disappear, All these thoughts they make no sense, I found bliss in ignorance, Nothing seems to go away, Over and over again\ Linkin Park - I'm About To Break lyrics,\Down comes the rain like a hurricane, Hard to breathe like a storm hangin’ over me, Comin’ to get me but I don’t have to let it in, I stand up - face my fears like an enemy\ Thousand Foot Krutch : Bring Me To Life,\And now you're dead inside Still you wonder why When you're on the edge and falling off It's all over for (You, for you) And now you're dead inside Still you wonder why When you're on the edge and falling off It's all over for (You, for you) And now you're dead inside Still you wonder why It's all over\ Three Days Grace : It's All Over Lyrics,It feels like everyday stays the same It's dragging me down and I can't pull away So here I go again Chas
