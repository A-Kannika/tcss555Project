Livi did a scary thing on Saturday! Two hours before her first birthday party she through a fit and as she sat on the floor crying because she couldn't chew on plastic (mean mom!) she turned blue, stopped breathing, and her eyes rolled back in her head. S,At Math Item Writing in Olympia for the week, woke up with pink eye and my phone got ran over in parking lot last night! UGH. I need summer to start!,was a little dazed. I never knew that this is VERY common. I learned babies can have a fit and hold their breath until they pass out, but then wake back up and have no side effects. I think I lost four years off my life with this experience. I am definite,Exhausted......Livi has been sick, so no rest for the weary! Bed at 7 sounds good.,Peaceful night at home with my husband and Livi. We just did Wii Fit. Started the 30-Day challenge. It was fun and sweaty!,It sucks....I get on here and read about all the fun people are having over the summer and I am jealous! Work all week and classes all weekend. No helicopte
