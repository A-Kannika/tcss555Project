Let me just say that my cousin's wedding looked like so much fun. Everyone looked great. I miss my family....,I am finally out of school and have my MBA!!!!! -  It's been a long 2 years and so much has changed in my life. I can't believe it's finally over.,Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who wrote such nice things to me about finishing my MBA! Love you all:),First day at Greendot. I love it! Only 15 mins from work. That's awesome given LA traffic. So glad to be back HOME with family and friends! I miss my hubby though........sad face:(.....Can't wait to kick-it cholita-style with my California Gurls soon: Anna, Lorissa, Becca, Brenda and Judy-Booty...and of course my awesome cousins:) Love you Gurls,I just wanted to say Thank You to everyone who wished me a Happy Birthday today. Many of you wrote some really nice things and that meant a lot to me! Thanks again!!!!!,Sleep is a gift...not a guarantee
