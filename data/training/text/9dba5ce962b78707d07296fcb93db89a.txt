Time to get some sleep after being up for 19 hours! Had fun though,kicked my left shin on the side of the step ladder at work one day, then fell all the way off it to the hard floor the next day. Time to re cooperate over my weekend now :P,1hr 40 minute commute home from work...longest commute in ages. *SCREAMS*,Its snowing outside,forgot how addicting The Sims 2 can be!,Dear whomever it may concern, YOU LEFT YOUR COUCH ON I-405!! And I almost ran into it with my beloved car, please come back to claim it. Much thanks, B,going to see Sherlock Holmes tonight. ROCK ON DOWNEY!,feels worse. A lot worse...:(,Avatar=AWESOME! 3D really helped immerse you into the world of Pandora, an outstanding visual piece of filmmaking!! IMAX was even better. The 3 1/2 hours of sleep I got after the midnight showing before work, not so great :P...TOTALLY WORTH IT,and now I'm sick :( Gotta get through the work day today!. Special shoutout thanks to Tom Singleton Thomas Dickerson Scott Moyes and Mark Allen Monson for surprising me a
