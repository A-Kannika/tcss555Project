is wondering why all gay people think they melt in the rain!,getting ready for CA,Back at the hotel after day one of training, all is well!!!,Finally finishing up my day in the office and going tanning! I know, I'm addicted even in the fall.,a good friend of mine had this as their status.... those of you who don't know her should know that.......There's always more than one way to skin a cat..but with dogs u don't really have to think long..they usually end up chasin their own damn tails anyway so its not a challenge,when it should hurt the most you find that there are people in your life who can carry you through without thought, reason or any selfish intent. Impulse and love are amazing things.,has had a great time in CA and is ready to get back home. Never thought I would say that. :),having a great morning, keep it moving kids!,I'm going to tip-toe to the window..... LOL,\Ain't nobody going to hold me, I'm going to be all that I can be. I'll take my problems to the dancefloor, let the music make my spirit
