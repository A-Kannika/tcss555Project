Not so bad after 3 rounds of novacaine or whatever it is now that they use,Vacations simply mean work overtime until you have accomplished everything you would have while your away,is letting frustration cloud his judgement,is a precious little snugglebug.,Consumer protection my ass.  BoA you people are idiots.  How can you possibly under calculate the monthly cost of a home by 11%?  How convenient that that low number was the number I thought I would pay when I signed everything.   Idiots.,Wells Fargo, you are also idiots.  Thank you for sending me a card and explicitly saying I can use my existing PIN
