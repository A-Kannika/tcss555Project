official facebook announcement:  I DID NOT MOVE TO PALESTINE TO FIND A HUSBAND AND GET MARRIED. I moved here for work and art and to find something within myself.  I have a private life and please everybody mind your own business and leave me alone.,Dear UMich School of Music Library:  I MISS YOU SO MUCH!  Please come to Ramallah so I can take out scores whenever the hell I want and listen to music and my favorite pieces over and over again without having to illegally download them and search for their scores online! COMPOSER SEEKS SCORES, PLEASE SCAN AND EMAIL THEM TO ME lol.,all moved into my new apartment here in Ramallah.  I don't have internet yet.  I have over 100 students.  October is my favorite month.  I'm writing a short story.  It's getting to be quite long.  . .
