THANK YOU CRISTY!!! *continues headbanging while listening to \My Obsession\* Christian rock&metal is the best.,I would like to be in a rock concert now. Skillet, TFK, Chris Cornell or even something I don't really like, but still is rockin. But of course, the best thing would be playing on stage! B
