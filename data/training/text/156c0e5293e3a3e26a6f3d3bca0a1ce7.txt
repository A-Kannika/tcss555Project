I don't wanna go on\
Living in this world without you,Yaaaaaaayyy!! I'm getting money, thanks to my studies. Good grades rule! Money money money :D,shit... I want my old life back..,Ah... Just figured out that I live in a city that has no Buddhist temples, no centres, nothing! Just great!.....\
And approximately there are about only 200 (i guess even not official) Buddhists from 1 million of the city's population....,English exam was easy... IT & math to go...\
P.s. If I die = I failed Math.\
Bury my body six feet down,\
Till you hear it, hit the ground :),one more good deed to my karma piggy bank :),My faith to Buddhism is fading... My arabian friends betray me. I hate them. One of them is sticking to the girl I'm about to date with.\
Can't wait for joining the USMC and make the bastards pay back.,oorah.. The camp is fun.. :D,Yesterday's friends are becoming enemies and enemies are becoming friends....,Ho-Ho-Ho! H"
