Every night before I go to sleep I lie on my bed and stare up at my blank walls. I try to imagine the future, but right now it's as blank as those walls. All I can see is a past that I barely recognize any more.,is watching wuthering heights :),Just sorted out my new phone :),Starting my new job 2day!!! :),OMG! just watched the finale of lost, it was so sad :(.,I remember one moment, I tried to forget, I lost myself, is it better not said, Now I'm closer to the edge\
It was a thousand to one, And a million to two, Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you, Closer to the edge\
No, I'm not saying I'm sorry, One day maybe we'll meet again, No, I'm not saying I'm sorry, One day maybe we'll meet again, 30 Seconds To Mars is the best :),passed my theory test 2day!! :),Happy New Year everybody xxx,?tom hardey ?"
