My poor daddy is sick for the first time in about 18 years...poor daddy! Unfortunately, I have to avoid him like the plague. I don't want to take risks with my moronic immune system!,thinks exercising outside is completely different from exercising inside. I thought I was going to fall over yesterday, got woozy and a bit nauseated. Evidently I need to wait even later...sun-going-down later.,went to the new park across from her house today and walked instead of using her boring-as-hell treadmill. I also got sidetracked and picked some blackberries, but I did extra walking to compensate!,is happy. I went to the park across from my house and had a good vantage point on about 5 different people setting off fireworks. I also stayed late enough until the little ones vacated the swings so I could get one! I love swinging so much...it's one of ,had fun tonight. I also wore a sleeveless top for the first time in more than 10 years.,is frickin' HAPPY! UGA just assigned parking and I got the EAST DECK! My first choice!
