Your AM is my PM... the sad reality of working nights...,7 days until vacation...,just discovered games on facebook... I'm slow to this whole thing, I know. P.S. Going on vacation in a few hours! WHOO!!!,Leaving in 2 hours for vacation... again. LOL,is randomly adding friends at the speed of light! I should totally be studying for my final test tomorrow, but since I'll get a B regardless of how I do on this test....,I clocked out from work, hungry for my dinner/your breakfast as usual. I passed the aisle with the pasta salad in a box and thought, \Hmm. That sounds good! I'll buy it!\ I just realized you have to cook the noodles and it lost it's appeal. There's always a catch, isn't there? ;),I LOVE VAMPIRE WARS!!!,I have to work tonight and I didn't sleep today... I'm thinking that wasn't so smart, and I'm sure I'll agree with myself around 3 am or so. ;),I'M BAAAAACK!!! For today anyway, and then we're off again tomorrow. Camping was fun, but I seriously missed my VAMPIRE WARS. ;),is so tired...she may vomit
