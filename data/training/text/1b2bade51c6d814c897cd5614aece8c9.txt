Hi mates! Wendy Woman is sending out a belated but sincere thank you for all the sweet  birthday wishes and posts! 40 feels 27 to me however (as some of you know so well) I like to be immature and childlike sometimes.,Manda was just cast as Gretel in the Sound of Music at her school!!!!! (It's an Arts Academy). I am so excited for her since she has been learning the part since she was two years old........ She is so tiny for 7 years old she looks like a pre-k almost (about 40 pounds). But she is very healthy. Yea!!!!,is posting a quote:  \I am worse than you think I am and better than you know.\  ~Wendy Schmidgall~,quote for today:  You're only as sick as your secrets.  ~Author Unknown,is posting a quote: If you surrender to the wind, you can ride it.  ~Toni Morrison,I'm just bored today. No energy. Oh well.,I never knew until that moment how bad it could hurt to lose something you never really had.  ~From the television show The Wonder Years,I just went and bought my husband an electric guitar for our annv.
