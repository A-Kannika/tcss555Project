Well Kimberly got stranded at work with this massive snow storm.  She had to spend the night in a 'scary motel'.  She didn't like it and just wanted to be home.,Our little guy is hopefully gonna be here soon...Kim is 2 cm dilated.  She had an ultrasound today, the little guy weighs 6.8 lbs and approx. 17 in long.  The little stinker had his arm across his face so the tech couldn't get a good pic of him!,We're gonna have another grandson!! So excited!,False alarm...thank god!,It's time!! On the way to the hospital.,It is official! Matthew Scott Nordin made his grand entrance at 0:14 on 3-14. He weighed in at 7 lbs 1 oz and 20 inches long.  He is by far the cutest baby ever to see the inside of that nursery! LOL,My little peanut had to go to ER, he was having withdrawl symptoms. Then they wanted to keep for observation overnight. Then they want to keep him another night to make sure he wasn't getting dehydrated from all the dirrhea he was having.  So, hopefully if everything goes right, he gets to come home Mon
