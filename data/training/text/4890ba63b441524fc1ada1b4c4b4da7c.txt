Thank you for your wishes! And thank you for being a wonderful friend :-)  I am really happy!!,Hi, Angela!!! I am fine;-) I started working last week here in Tokyo. I am working for a Japanese oil & gas company. So I have to get up early in the morning now...admittedly it is hard (-_-;)\

How are you?\
It is extremely hot here this summer. I feel as if I were in the sauna bath everyday :( I miss you and pretty Spanish friends!!!\
