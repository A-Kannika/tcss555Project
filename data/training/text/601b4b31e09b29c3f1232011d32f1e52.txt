got off work a little while ago. It took forever to close tonight, yet I am not tired at all.,so it wasn't a turning lane. Whatever. the lady didn't have to be THAT mad. right?,Facebook is becoming crappy. Too complicated. I yearn for the simplicity I first joined for.,is pretty sure you are supposed to aim for the cars when playing golf. It's a lot easier to hit off of pavement.,lost voice. Feels like crap. Shearing sheep tomorrow and perhaps baling hay, then work afterward. FML.,wants fair to get here quickly.,just woke up from a nap, getting to bet might be a little difficult now.,sheep show went great. Not as well as last year, but still great. Now time to relax and have fun instead of worry.,needs motivation.,tired and thanking God for the day off.,finally home for a few a little while.,sad that tomorrow is the last day of fair.,is dry. After about 40 water balloons, two buckets and many other miscellaneous wettening items later.,sore all over. Work better not be busy tonight.,back home. leave tomorrow f
