Is thinking she needs to go do something!,But it doesn't matter how I feel now, anything at all Since I've left you with the wrong impression while I'm still the same, When I turn around and look at my life, shadows in disguise....,I could follow you to the beginning and just relive the start and maybe then we'll remember to slow down to all of our favorite parts,If I'm a bad person, you don't like me Well I guess I'll make my own way It's a circle A mean cycle I can't excite you anymore,Going to Mariah's after work to play World of Warcraft!!,I'm in love with Krystal Lemke,I'm growing so distant Nothing makes sense to me anymore I'm learning to resist Becoming more than you ever were ( this is a song mom!),Going to Watertown!,I've hoped for change, and it gets better everyday I've hoped for change, but still I feel the same...  And I'll confess That I can be a little selfish And I'll admit I don't want you to help me through this I don't want to start over again,GOING TO MARIAHS !,I'll bet two years I'll bet
