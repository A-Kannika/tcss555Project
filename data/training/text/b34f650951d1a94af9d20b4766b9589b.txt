i haven't been on facebook in awhile lol,Hmmm?,i don't even know what to do with myself right now...,can't wait until next weekend. :P,Home is behind, the world ahead. And there are many paths to tread. Through shadow, to the edge of night. Until the stars are all alight. Mist and shadow, cloud and shade. All shall fade, All shall fade.,lol, has to catch up on some English homework... gotta hate getting sick.,sometimes i hate my computer, its so slow today.,Writing songs... basically like righting poetry lol. I love it. : ),Today was an absolutely amazing day,Had a really good weekend. : ),well, i'm off to get my tux for prom. :),I miss you so much...,good night, sweet dreams.,freedom does not come from physical means,just the direction that your heart leans.the key to freedom we cannot see,but it does come from someone like you & me.to remove these chains and free your heart,you must give up this rather important part.With trust and love you send it away,you know that it will be returned one day.with a smile
