Desires, can sometimes be Sinful, unwanted and a huge pain when u see ur bank statement ....,What is life if full of care .. You don't have time to stand & stare !!!,Met an Old Friend at a Railway Station, realised that Time & Train wait for no Man !!!!,The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep And miles to go before I sleep,Wishing All my Friends out here a very Happy Diwali & Prosperous New Year ... Enjoy !!!,Aasmaan hai Nila kyu ?? Pani gila gila kyu ? Gol kyu hai zameen ??? seems more like a few lines from a Science textbook than a song :P,wonders what is True LOVE ?!?!?,sometimes i go crazy ... about this lady .... who makes my life worth living ..,the heart aches more than anything elz .....,The night is new & the times are lonely ... its been really long since i am searching for my honey. Its a moon lit sky and the stars are shining ... to hold ur hand is all my longing,A decent place to hang out, some good food and great F.R.I.E.N.D.S for company
