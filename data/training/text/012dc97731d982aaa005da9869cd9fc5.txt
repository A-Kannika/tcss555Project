???A friend is one of the nicest things you can have, and one of the best things you can be.  ~Douglas Pagels?;)?,1st day ng simbang gabi people!take care and God bless us all!:),Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over. - Gloria Naylor.,The best time to make friends is before you need them.,Are u thinking about someone when u alone? when u watch a love movie, u will imagine that u and him/her was the main character..when u see something sweet u want to give it to that person...when u talk to that person u can't look straight into his/her eyes, your heart beat so fast..and if u thinking about someone when u read this text, u are in love with that person..Love is so honest...don't lie to yourself..,*:) Never explain yourself. Your friends don’t need it and your enemies won’t believe it.     - Belgicia Howell...\Check!\\
