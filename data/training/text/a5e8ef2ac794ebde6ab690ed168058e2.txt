We had an absolutely fantastic time at Nature's Art for Kaisa's birthday party today..the girls mined gemstones in the mine, made their own beaded necklaces, dug for fossils in the life size dinosaur maze complete with climbing wall and zip line, learned about geology...and that was just a selection of the activities they had indoors, never mind outside.,we'lup another night of no sleep,  so I am making myself a treat for breakfast, grilled cheese and fresh sliced heirloom tomato with a dash of salt.  Decided to skip the bacon this time...too lazy to cook real bacon and that microwave stuff is fine in a pinch or a recipe but not on my seasonal tomato sandwiches.,Anybody in NE or Central CT have a pick up truck we can borrow on Saturday???,That old cliche, 'don't judge another until you walk a mile in their shoes' has just been rattling around in my head for days now, i feel like I need to scream it.,it is 10/10/10 and it is Kaisa's 7th birthday!  Happy birthday to my precious fighter, it is time to celebrate
