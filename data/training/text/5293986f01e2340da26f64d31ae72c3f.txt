i see the person that is trying to ruin my family has left face book,still alive and kicking working hard thanks for the thoughts, hope you have a good day,There comes a point in life when \fun\ no longer means club hopping or partying too much and staying out all night. It means family time, trips to the park, and bedtime stories. Sleeping in means maybe 8 a.m. Becoming a parent doesnt change you, its realising that the little people you made deserve the best of your free time! Repost if you are PROUD to be a \boring\ Responsible parent,you havnt been on book for a while,I would like to thank my wife for tha most amazing weekend and all the friends and comany the shared it with us,Well you think you know somebody, you give them your all, including your life blood and then they lie and lie and go into denial to win court cases. GOD says forgive, well he has now taken my happiness , my family and my life , and today my son as well, Melany I hope you can live with yourself and sleep at night.,A clever man once
