i can feel you across the miles in my body, almost physical, spiritual... like there was no separation, like you were right beside me...,... i'm turning around the same thoughts behind,you will find me in the place i know the best, flying to the moon...,i sto vise zelim da ne mislim na tebe, to manje uspevam...,and the smoke in my eyes makes it hard not to cry... why you gone? the reason is suppose to make sense... but it don't,you know your love is perfect like the stars, when we're together, here in my imagination...,counting days...,... lost in your blue eyes...,eskimi su verovali da je svaka levoruka osoba ?arobnjak...,ko hoce nesto da ucini, nadje nacin; ko nece nista da ucini nadje opravdanje...,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wPo5ZWmSc,it's still the same, darling still the same, at the mention of your name...,you know that you're never number two...,uziva s Jecom <3,?¸¸??•*¨*•.¸¸? ?¸¸.•*¨*•??
