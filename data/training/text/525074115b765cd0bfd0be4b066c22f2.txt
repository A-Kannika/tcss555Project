Half of my heart is back in Bethpage.,I know i just posted a status moments ago.  But i just have to share this moment with the facebook world.  Just got into my dorm.  Pants are soaked.(mind you if i had my boots would not be)...cold...tired...hungry. So i opened a good ol can of classic chicken noodle...slapped some CRUNCHY peanut butter on some bread...and man did it lift my spirits!,is wishing she wasn't going to be an hour away from her loverboy on his Big 18! HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAMDON RICHARD GREEN!  Love you Angel.,Knowledge acquired from the evening... Walmart in Cookeville Tennessee is sold out of umbrellas. Ranch Baked Potatoes at Backyard Burger on campus are well worth the walk at 9 oclock at night. It also only rains in this city when all us poor college students have to go to class....it especially rains more on those less fortunate whose rainboots don't arrive till next tuesday.,Arrival at library 7:59 p.m. Departure from library. 11: 07 p.m. No matter what grade i make on my organic chemistry midt
