Don’t meet me when its autumnBecause the fall is sad.Each falling leave reminds meOf each fight we hadDon’t meet me in spring,Because then rosebuds bloom…It reminds me of your beauty,wich is my sworn doom.Don’t meet me in the summer,Because then ice will melt…Because it reminds me of problemsWhich with you and I had dealt.So meet me in the winterIts so cold thenYou cant feelThese wounds… that won’t heal.,\TIME PASSES. EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN when each tick of te second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise. It passes unevenly, in strange amounts and dragging lulls, but pass it does.
