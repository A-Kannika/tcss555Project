This world is too small and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.,Pfft, gotta update this darn thing~,I wonder what I'll do this weekend, three day weekend! Yayzors =],Writing again! Isn't that jazzy =],How I spent my day today: Giggling incessantly over imagining boys shaking their butts. I love my best friends!,I don't like these classes much, but at least having less friends means I'll learn more (hopefully?),Today is as bad as watching the View is good.,Making a mixed cd. I wonder if people realize how much time and thought goes into making one?,Everytime it rains, just imagine me jumping in puddles.,What can be done tomorrow is usually done tomorrow, but then you realize tomorrow became today and then you feel royally screwed. God I'm horrible xD,Steamed duck. Kinda makes this worth it.,I'm really hoping Stauffer isn't gonna be mean and bring my 90 A down to a C or whatever. Perhaps I should turn in a crap load of homework that I didn't/never do. Now I just need to figure out what they are.
