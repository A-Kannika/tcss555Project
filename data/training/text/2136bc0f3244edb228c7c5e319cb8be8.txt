Life itself still remains a very effective therapist. \,\You will know that forgiveness has begun when you recall those who hurt you and feel the power to wish them well.\,Goodnight FB world (\,),oh well, shyt happens...and it's not funny when it does,Today is my lucky day *wishful thinking*,Nite (\,),I hate it when i'm sad :((,\Life is what you make of it. Always has been, always will be.\ Good Morning! (\,),\Life can be found only in the present moment.  The past is gone, the future is not yet here,  and if we do not go back to ourselves in the present moment,  we cannot be in touch with life.\,\Be miserable or motivate yourself...Whatever has to be done, its always your choice.\,Had fun in clinicals today! ^_^,\Smiling ope
