HAPPY TURKEY DAY,OMG.  A body should not have to feel this worn out.  And people wonder why I don't get into the holiday season.,I think I have a ghost that likes to break things and see me spend money.  First my microwave now my Direct TV DVR.  The DVR is only 6 months old.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,Playing farkle while listening to the world ending as the wind blows and the rain falls,And why did I get a puppy?  She is going to spend more time in her kennel than outside of it if she keeps chewing stuff arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.,Do they have a Farkle rehab somewhere because I have a problem.  I think that is the first step in recovery.,It's December 9th at 10:20pm and 69 degrees outside.  How great is that.  I love the south.,I finally found a wrinkle remedy.  CLOSE YOUR EYES!!!!!!,Somebody needs to talk me out of getting another cattle dog.,Spring has sprung!!!!!!!! WOOOO HOOOO,I have to say I can cook a mean Christmas dinner.  Wish y'all could have been here.  But I have some very happy dogs here right now.,Indi
