roll tdie roll....,i love a girl that can play guitar!,would love to be on the pacific coast of mexico lookin ut over the ocean with a cold beer,lovin my life and my girl,aint it funny how some ppl never dissapoint you, because you always knew that they were gonna grow up to be a punk,all ppl have flaws: men, have this bad habbit of thinkin they are superior beings. women, dream girls eventually become real. kids, they always grow up to one of the two above....,same ol bull just diffrent digits,sometimes it amazes me how stupid ppl are. you dont have to make them look stupid cuz they do a fine job on their own.,life is goin good,feels like a dump truck run me over
