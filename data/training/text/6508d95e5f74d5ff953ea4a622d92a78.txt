Watching the Hurt Locker,Contact just fell off my eye and flew halfway across the room, contemplating breaking something.,Having a Veronica Mars marathon, forgot how good this show was.,Just looked outside, have the sudden urge to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas,It is so freaking beautiful outside my window right now, WHY don't I have my camera,Found the original vinyl of Pink Floyd's The Wall in a closet, this day is officially awesome.,LIGHTS Happy Birthday LIGHTS!,LIGHTS Take me river, carry me far\
Lead me river, like a mother\
Take me over to some other unknown\
Put me in the undertow,LIGHTS Winter left a cover \
that I'm gonna end up under \
But I've got my boots \
\
When I'm in the summer I forget how much I love her \
When she's in the groove \
\
Oh, it's a love hate romance \
Cause I could watch her dance \
If I've got my boo-ooo-oo-oooots,If anyone asks, I'm watching the royal wedding because I have insomnia.,Sooooo, can we be done with the whole Iraq business now?,I am a spackling god!,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGG"
