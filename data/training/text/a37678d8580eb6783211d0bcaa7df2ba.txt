Ok, having been on Livejournal for posting, this limited post size one face book is going to take some getting used too.,I'm not sure what I should feel now, and what I do feel changes from moment to moment.  Anger, frustration, shame, guilt, numb, depressed...  the list goes on.  And the entirre time the one thing I do know is I need to show my mom a strong face even as I want to scream and cry myself.,Bed time.  Busy day getting the last pieces of my costume.  For those who know what it is, shush.  It's more than you've been told by certain wives who have no concept of surprises.  <G>  I'll post pics as soon as I can though.,Maybe it's just cause I'm older, but just got a new appreciation of why women are so cold all the time.  Really don't remember being this cold last time I was clean shaven.,For those who don't know, my mom's recovering from another stay in the hospital.  She is stressing out about money because of it.
