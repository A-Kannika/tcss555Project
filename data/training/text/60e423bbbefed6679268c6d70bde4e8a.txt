Drove up from Great Falls to the highline burg of Shelby this morning.   Had picked up a load of restaurant stuff from Sam's Club for my sis and the Last Chance Cafe' in Sunburst, MT.   Met sis in Shelby and transfered stuff, then I spent the rest of the day with Mom in the Marias Nursing Center.  Physically she is doing as well as can be expted, but no short term memory to speak of.,*sigh* ... We wound up the day playing bingo with several other \inmates\ and really did have a good time.  Mom co-won the blackout and split the $1.50 cash purse.  LOL   I'm now in Sunburt hanging out at the Cafe.,her.  So I am a happy camper today.,This from friend Tim, a weather guy:  Officially 12.8\ of snow in Great Falls (5AM Tues to 5AM Wed). Heavy, wet snow to boot.  WE were not amused (especially since I had to shovel the crap to get to my car, not to mention the hot tub!  Grrrrr!  I'm thinking, a South American vacation is way over due.  *heavy sigh*    On another note:  THE TAXES are done!  E-filed, and it's too late t
