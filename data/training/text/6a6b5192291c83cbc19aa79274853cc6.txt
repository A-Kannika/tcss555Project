IF I SEE YALL ONE ON ONE IN THE PAVEMENT U GON SEE A REAL HOOD CHICK! PUT DAT ON URRRTHANG!:),back when when pop tarts were sacred and nobody dated,\
boys hated girls and we all still related.\
before we had feelings, before we got hurt,\
before we wore bras underneath our shirts.\
back when we watched cartoons after school,\
and the kid with the play station was cool.\
before we got pregant\
before we did drugs,\
before we shot people in the name of love.,God please help me control my anger,Girls need to learn to change their mind set on things. Do not throw stones if u aren't prepared to catch them."
