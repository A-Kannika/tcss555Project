Free healthcare and money to buy food!  What a life haha,Just went paintballing for the first time.  I have a lot of welts... and two really good blood ring ones too :),feels like crap... mentally.,Hmm... Im tired...  I think I will go to town early today...  Thank God for Bible studies!!,For the first time in a long time, words don't flow from me...  Sit down and cry for my heart just fell down and died...,is still here... sort of.  If you need to contact me, try my email.  beautifulwalker@ymail.com   Thanks,I woke up this morning to the sound of my little nephew, butt naked, peeing on my floor.  /sigh,fml,Just got kicked out of the first laundromat... Good thing there is more than one :),Words still arent flowing... so I am waiting...,Food turns to ash in m
