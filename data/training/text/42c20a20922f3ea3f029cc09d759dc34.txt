Frohe Weihnachten!,Happy New Year Everyone!,\Lips & Ears.\\ If your lips can keep from slips these things keep meekly hid.  Myself and I and Mine and My, and How I Do and Did. If your ears can save from jeers five things observe with care. Of Whom you speak To Whom you speak and How and When and Where.\,Ich mochte allen meinen deutschkurs freunden fur die geburtstags grusse danken! :) Und viel gluck fur den nachsten kurs! :D,Gott sei Dank, System of a Down kommt nach Deutschland!,Thanks everyone for your wonderful birthday wishes!\

:D,Who actually reads my posts? Let's see who reads this entirely... leave me a one word comment that best describes me, using the FIRST letter of your LAST name. It can only be ONE word. Then, copy this to your wall so I can leave a word about you. Don't just post a word and not copy, that's no fun."
