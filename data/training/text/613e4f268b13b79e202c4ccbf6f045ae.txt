\love its not like chocolate sweet that you think,love is various kind of flavor sweet ,bitter,sour and even tasteless,but after you tasted it all you concluded that \
you have to taste all the test to find what is really the flavor of your love\",HE gives me work that I may seek HIS rest,HE gives me strenght to meet the hardest test;and as I walk in providential grace,I find that joy goes with me,at God's pace.,THE God-shaped void within our heart cannot be filled by treasure;it's only God who satisfies in ways we cannot measure."
