life is like a box of chocolates; it starts real good then you leave it in your car and then it melts and you debate on drinking the rest. your choice is it worth the sugar rush,i am stuck in this ship of life without a paddle and will a huge whole in my boat but i thought that was a the worst thing well the only good news is that i was on dry land....yeah a desert.......thank you life,humility.....NOT A COMMON AMERICAN TRAIT.....i guess it was made in china,i want to find a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.......but with my luck it would be filled with weed and the only thing worth it is if i would sell it in which case it is still illegal and not only that lepraucans are probably run by blood diamonds... so im screwed even if i was rich,life......reality? matrix? religion? where is the start of an opinion and when does it become yours and can you really have your own or is it just a common thought to someone else,everything you know is wrong\
black is white, up is down and short is long\
and everything you"
