I went to TN and I had a little fun, but was really bored.,Sleeping is for the living,To many hours to wait for another time and date. Crying always never clear what the moment will reveal.,Alone is just a word, I'm afraid that I I'm to gone to now.  The pain the probably goes with it.,I've changed myself a bit.  see if you notice next time you see me,Though the world is never clear. I shall always stand and fight the fear. I'm ever enduring the pain of the day to day life we have,The world shall never take me alive, I shall not allow my own darkness to take me down no matter what happens.,Happy bunnies and sunshine for everyone....yeah right like I would wish that.,Your name is helping unite against hate at charactersunite.com,don't want to go to school tomorrow, but sadly have to.,A thousand deaths wont. One life can mean more then another.  It depends upon the person.  I wish it was a lie.,\Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution
