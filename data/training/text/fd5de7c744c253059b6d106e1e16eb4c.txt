Had an awesome day for Jordan's 7th Birthday. Took 7 of his friends and Caleb to Rainbow's End. So much fun!,I was reasonably entertained by Stars in their Eyes - but tonight's final is sooo boring! They should have to sing a different song by their artist. And as for Simon Barnett ... a nice guy ... but?!,Am relieving as an Art teacher for two weeks for Years 2 - 8 at  St Kents. Very cool job!,is looking forward to Reef Bar tonight and Copper Room tomorrow night (if the All Blacks win!),NSW just won! Rob's happy. Pricey shouldn't throw punches.,Hey Lizard - The Reef Bar was really fun last night! Thought it would be quiet coz of the weather but the dancefloor was still going off at 1.45am ...,just giving the rest of you a whole lot of really deep, insightful quizzes you too can try...?!,Aretha Franklin woman is awesome on 'Stars in their Eyes'! Quick watch it...,The Copper Room went off,  so Saturday night should be even better! They loved the 'Tool' song at the end!,The sunny weather brought everyone out -
