Getting ready to make a late night run to get my baby some pull ups! The end of potty training can't come soon enough! :(,Trying to get comfortable while my active son is kicking and doing flips! 2 months and counting!,It is 4:34 in the morning and I wish I could sleep. This pregnancy insomnia is getting old real fast!! :(,Starting a slow count down to \D\ day. 32 weeks and counting! :),Getting ready to start a day of cooking, fellowship and fun. Glad that the fam was able to come and spend time with us and see Jordan enjoy his first Thanksgiving. :),Thanksgiving was perfect. The food had me in a coma and my fam had me laughing. These are the times you live for. Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday. :),Enjoyed a great lazy day with the family. Can't wait for Christmas and being able to spend some much needed QT with my mom. I guess it's time to get the tree and start decorating the house to get into the spirit. I love the holidays. :),The day after Thanksgiving is always a lazy day. Enjoyed catching up on so
