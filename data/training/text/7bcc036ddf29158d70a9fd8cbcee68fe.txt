Can't wait to see my girls and all the people I have missed the past 2 years.  I desperately need a break from work too! So does Geoffrey! He deserves it more than me. Can't wait to see Zac too. We miss him soo,Very upset with my girls. I DO NOT LIKE THEM BEING IN MINNESOTA!,Went to Lacey's graduation party that Missy threw her. I was so happy to see my girls, it's been 20 days since I saw them. Seems alot longer.,Made it home safe and sound. Glad to see my puppies :-),So glad to have my girls home even if they do drive me crazy once in a while. Not so much glad to be here in Marion, NC.  I NEED out of here!  I am going crazy...,Heading back to NC tomorrow. Got my tattoos,visited friends and family and picking up my girls. Life is great.,Feeling much better today. It's amazing what some old antibiotics I found will do. Much easier than actually goi
