I am getting ready to go to Psychology class I hope I can stay awake for the whole thing!!!,It amazes me that with all the proof of the creator around us everyday there are those who doubt his existence!!!,It is awesome to watch God work in the hearts of his believers and move unbelievers to Him. This past week at camp was so rewarding.,It was a wonderful day with my daughter the rain and good conversation.,I feel blessed that God's grace is sufficient to cover all the stupid things that I do and wise enough to use and idiot like me for His glory!!!,There is a family that is in desperate need of prayer tonight. May the Lord work in a mighty way to show His love for them all.,It was another amazing week at camp! Is it selfish for a counselor to get as much, or more, from camp as the kids?,Listening to the awesome group Flatfoot 56!!!,We often take oaths and pledge our allegiance to our country but Jesus said we shouldn't swear an oath so are we going against God's word?
