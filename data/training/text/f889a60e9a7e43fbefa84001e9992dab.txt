 if you are lucky enough to have at least one :).,I'm having a bit of a runny nose and am afraid I might be catching a cold. I will try to stave it off with orange juice tomorrow.,Merry Christmas everyone! I just want to let everyone know that the orange juice worked, and I didn't get a full blown cold. Actually, as far as my health goes, for those who are interested, I'm doing very well! My legs are getting stronger, and are no longer leaking water, and my doctor has taken me off of some of my anti-rejection medication for the Graft vs. Host disease. Also, I just feel pretty good in general."
