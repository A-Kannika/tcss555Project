is on vacation for 10 days!!!!,I'm so sick and tired of people trying to create drama when there really is no need for it. But i guess that is just the way it goes when you work with a bunch of imature people that don't seem to have anything better to do with there time. As for me from now on I'm just going to work and gonna do the best job that I can and stay out of it all. I'm not there to be anyones friend.,Had a very busy day and tomorrow is looking like it may be just as busy...,Thank you everyone for your Birthday wishes, for those of you that didn't  wish me a happy birthday that's ok there is always next year ;),Stuff is so messed up right now..... not sure what I'm gonna do!,can't wait till tomorrow it's my friday!!,Blah!,My baby turned 12 today! man i feel so old right now!!!,I had an amazingly awesome day at work...must have been the good oldies music.,Hope Ray's tests turn out alright.
