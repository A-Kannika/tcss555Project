24-7 RMFT!!!!,Something's wrong and I will not be the only one trying to fix it. And that's if its supposed to be fixed. Seems like I'm the only one can see that the picture is crooked.,I love you sooo much but I'm sooo worried. Something's wrong. Something's changed. Just wish that you would talk to me like you used to.,I know you want me back. Its time to face the facts that I'm the one that got away. Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another life. Thank God I found the good in goodbye!-Best I Never Had
