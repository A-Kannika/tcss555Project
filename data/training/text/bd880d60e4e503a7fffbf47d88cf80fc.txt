What's on my mind?  Modular forms and elliptic curves! Infinite fire revolving around infinite parallels fractals of infinite reality, each cascading, gliding in an infinite wheel. Tell me the true nature of my reality!,It is done :D,ATM ate my card!!! Guess it was hungry.poor thing....,Playing  with dolls...,Oppression is the holy law\
\
In God I distrust\
\
In time His monuments will fall\
\
Like ashes to dust\
\
Is war and greed the masters plan?\
The bible's where it all began\
\
Its propaganda sells despair\
\
And spreads the virus everywhere\
\
Religion is hate\
\
Religion is fear\
\
Religion is war\
Religion is rape\
\
Religion's obscure\
\
Religion's a whore,Why does it always has to be like this? F-U-C-K.......,mda....,Under the moonspell....,Ce scump e un mers in oras fara centura...,ce pretentii poti avea de la studenti daca NORMATIVUL(=lege) e plin de greseli?"
