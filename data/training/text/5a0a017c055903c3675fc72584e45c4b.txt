This has been a rather busy 2 weeks or so.,Two days off for fall break...\
\
One of them I don't have any scheduled classes for anyway, and the other I have to stick around for so that I can go to a team meeting for a case study in one of my classes. \
\
Not that I was really planning to go anywhere, but its the principle of the thing...,Ichibi no Tanuki, Sabaku no Shukaku (One tailed raccoon-dog, Shukaku of the Desert Sands).,This is My Birthday Song, it isn't very long, HEY!! ;-)=,Foood... food before class is good....\
