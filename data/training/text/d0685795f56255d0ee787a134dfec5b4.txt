Here we fcking go,Finished Zelda: Windwaker. Now i have nothing to do.,Couldnt sleep so I went for a walk at 5 o clock in the morning,Cut my thumb open before i realised that there was a finger tab and leather arm guard with the bow i bought. I wont be making that mistake again :P,Here I go again on my own, walking down the only road ive ever known,\If theres a bustle in your hedge row, dont be alarmed now. Its just a spring clean for the may queen, theres still time to change the path your on\ Led Zepplinn-Stairway to Hevean,Got the course i wanted,There are many who dont find my drunken interesting facts very intereseting.
