I am ready for a nice, long vacation on an island far, far away where there is WARM SUNNY WEATHER!!!!! And some nice eye candy wouldn't hurt either (he-he, sorry Jimmy),Too much on my mind...not enough mind capacity to handle it all!,I am ready for a nice, long, warm vacation away from the snow and my job! Somewhere I would only need to pack a swimsuit and sunblock, that's it!!
