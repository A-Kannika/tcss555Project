Hi to all.  I very seldom have time to jump on here.  So don't think I am ignoring you.  Hope y'all are doing well.  Love to all.  Gotta go.,Hey you guys.  I know Leslie posted some new pictures so jump onto her Facebook and check them out.  She'll have to show me again how to add new photos.  Love to all, Shell,Still working on photos.  Leslie had to show me again.   Things are looking up here.  It is getting warmer!  You know you are a true NoDak when the temp is 20 and you aren't cold anymore.   Love to all!,Hey Mom.  Just wanted to say thanks for turning me into a Cafe junky.  I have spoiled several dishes.  I forget about them and come back and they are green and gross.  It's fun though and distracting.  Love you guys.  Have a great day!  It's hump day.  Yahoo!,Going bananas with all this darn snow and now sub temps.  Have to say...I am really tired of it already.  Oh yeah...and trying to learn how to attach pictures without having to ask Leslie-Ann again.  Just give me time.  I'll get it eventually!,\Lo
