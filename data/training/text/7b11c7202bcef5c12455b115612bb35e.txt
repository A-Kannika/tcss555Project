The kittens we have been nurturing left to go to a foster home today. We are suffering empty nest syndrome!  They were very cute and cuddly but it takes a lot to feed and care for 6 (count 'em) kittens.,Just got back from the movie \The Proposal\  Recommended date movie.,Heading out to enjoy the late afternoon sunshine,Survived the night...kind of awkward to sleep with a giant splint wrapped around the lower half of the leg...upside is, I haven't really needed the heavy duty painkillers prescribed.,Got the unwieldy splint/dressing off my poor left leg/ankle.  I have a boot to use for the next couple weeks but I get to go back to work tomorrow..Hooray!!,Made it back home after a great late afternoon/early evening spent with my cousin and his lovely wife.,Just got home from seeing Topol's farewell performance tour of Fiddler on the Roof....we were in the 4th row from the stage. It was fantastic! Well work staying up late on a work night!!,Had a good day. Went to church, out to lunch at Famous Dave's barbecue wi
