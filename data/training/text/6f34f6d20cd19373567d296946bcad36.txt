Wondering how many \Bill and Jessie\ sightings I will have this week...,Is very confused.....in general,is meloncoly blue.........,It sucks when you can not reach the knife that was slamed in to your back, and then was strategically twisted....I'm no Columbo, but I know I've been bambuzzled BIG TIME!    Nuts...you would think I could/would learn.  I will get the last laugh though......I promise that one!!  Will go out like a champ!!!  Sucka,Is wondering why her new puppy did her business on the wee-wee pads yesterday without me even trying, but today decided that her house is one big wee-wee pad!,didn't realize that her dog was so \svelt\ under all that fur!  It is bugging me out! :(  She got some extra slices of turkey and ham tonight!,'s (prescribed) steriods are making her meannnnnn!  At least that is how I am justifying it...,is thinking about how stressful her week is going to be...while drinking Crystal Light and Barcardi (desperate times call for desperate measures)....,is getting off of the \treadmill
