sledding and snowboarding... fairly productive day i suppose,worked a 14 hour day today...needless to say, i'm exhausted...funny thing though, it was still less stressful than dealing with my physics homework,this morning i looked everywhere for the table sugar with no success, gave up and found it...in the fridge behind the milk... i reeeally enjoy putting things away aaaahaha,God be with Egypt,just doing a little holiday treat making =) cookies, chexmix, and muddy buddies. Tomorrow I hope to get to the meringue kisses, fudge and chocolate covered pretzels, but I can already feel myself starting to backdown...we'll see,misses being bored...stressed and stretched too thin is really beginning to suck,Only fools get angry quickly \
 and hold a grudge. http://bible.us/Eccl7.9.CEV,feeling overwhelmed by the trig required to do my physics hw,grr...grasshoppers officially ate all the corn i planted...okra still coming up well though,not looking forward to the work about to be required for new career path...tomorrow'"
