Wow work was rough today, worked 2 hours at 3/4 speed and felt like I had worked 12 at 100%. This whole recuperation thing is a pain in the aaaaaass!!,If your life doesn't have a bright side.......then polish the darkside.,KOC is back,So I was gonna get some thanksgiving stuff I forgot when I went to the store before, but the 3 stores on the way home were stupid packed, no parking whatsoever,Stressed out.....oh what to do?,How does one live when all happiness is gone? When there is nothing left but emptiness? I wish there was a way to just turn off, cease to exist. Maybe then the hurt would end, and joy could be found on the other side.....,Thank god it's finally the weekend......this week totally sucked,Don't want to eat, can't sleep, stressed as all get out. I thought things were getting better but I guess I was wrong. Life is sh!t,Driving a delivery truck and delivering heavy furniture for 13 1/2 hours is exhausting.,Will you ever understand what you mean to me? Or am I doomed to fighting a battle of never
