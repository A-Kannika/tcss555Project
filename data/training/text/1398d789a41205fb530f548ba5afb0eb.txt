sitting at home....... contemplating the future...... so lost trying to figure it all out........ feels so alone in it all.......,join my bloodline and my sorority......... you don't have to do anything else but join and add me...........,i need more people to join my clan on bloodlines........ JOIN ME!,pissed off...... keep getting ditched and having to hear about why from someone else...... and now my cable box is fucked...... great day to be me,i start work tomorrow morning........,feels like everyone would rather be anywhere but here..... and those that are here would rather be with anyone other than me,feels so alone........ wishes chris hadn't gone back to lubbock...... i miss him so much....... i feel so empty without him,feels like she is always in the way, or messing up, or just being bothersome..... maybe i should just quit doing everything i do ........... *hides in corner to ensure she doesn't bother anyone*,arm's not broke...... cracked through radial head........ no cast....... no splint..... ju
