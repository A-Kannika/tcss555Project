I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways And that's the way it stays,I shall know but one country. The ends I aim at shall be my country’s, my God’s and Truth’s. I was born an American; I live an American; I shall die an American.\ -- Daniel Webster,If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize. - muhammad Ali,Everybody should believe in something; I believe I'll have another drink.,If your heart filled with faith then you can't fear Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin Easy, let go and let GOD deal with it,America was targeted for attack because we are the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world, and no one will keep that light from shining.\-George W. Bush,****CHANGE IN PLANS**** im goin out sat and sun for my bday...be there....,said I'm stressed out..so tired my days..so long said I'm stressed out..so tired gotta..move on.... I needa vacation,I am the greatest, I said that even before I knew I was.   -Muha
