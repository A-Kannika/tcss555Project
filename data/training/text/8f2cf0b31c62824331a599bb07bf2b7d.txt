wishing i had someone to cuddle up to on the couch and watch a good movie with,looking for that right guy seems to be hard these days. you seem to have thought you found mister right and it turns out to be oh boy wrong.,so bored and so tired of games people play only wish people would grow the fuck up and worry about themselves. maybe if they did that then there would be less drama in everyones life,so glad that all 6 kids r behaving. just hope it last the rest of the day,everythings looks as if everythings looking up for me.. i found me a great guy that treats me and my kids with respect and all the love in the world and then finding out i got the job ive been waitting for... this weeks been wonderful. hope it continues this way!!!!!!!!!!!,Happy Father's Day to all the men out there!!! And to the women that are the mother and father to there kids. its hard but we still get it done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5 in the morning and wide a wake on a sunday,Y do men act like little kids when together why not grow up?,
