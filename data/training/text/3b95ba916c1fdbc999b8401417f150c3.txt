After about 18 months of planning im now only a few hours away from going to canada for 10 days to have a total crazy huskey sledging adventure for my gold DoE; cant wait to rip a polar bear to shit, see the northen lights and just generally have banter with the DoE team :D,writing on the ipad in the apple store in toronto at the end of what has to be one of the best holidays ive ever been on ?D ?D ?D xxxxxx,Back from the canadian wilderness, had an absolutly amazing time. One of the best bits of the trip has to be playing a 18 man game of football on top of a frozen lake, one of the most sureall experiences ever; slide tackles were absolutly crazy :L :D,I've just finnished playing poker with my family, were my mum was losing badly, this was her mad attempt at coming back;\
