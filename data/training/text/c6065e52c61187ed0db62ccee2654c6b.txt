Haven't seen too much of E3, though the MGS3 on 3ds looked really good.  Anyone else see things they really liked?,Just plays some songs on my clarinet, felt good and felt bad.  Good to relive my joy of music and the expression it allows, bad because of how awful I am at it now and how far I have to work to be even decent again.  It's still there though, I'm sure.  I promised one of my lab buddies that I would play something at our retreat this Saturday...haha... we shall see if I can't pull something through!,The retreat with my lab turned out really nice, especially when they weren't all talking in Chinese, haha.  A lot of them were really good cooks and some of the couples brought their kids.  I ended up playing a lot more than anticipated but they seemed to enjoy it all.  Professor even mentioned making a band since he has some dream with the drums.  hmmmmm....,As always, the UB fireworks were great this year.  Back to Cornell tomorrow.,Ok, I knew facebook apps are bad, so my expectations were pretty low,
