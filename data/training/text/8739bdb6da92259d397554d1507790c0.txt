Hello James, that's excellent news but I always knew you were a genius. Have you decided what degree you want to do yet? Seen the pics of the new puppy - she looks so cute but must be so tough not having Mollie. I am ok busy doing job applications and trying to find a two day a week role. Have an interview Tuesday morning.  Not sure yet what I'm doing for Christmas. Anyway sure I'll see you soon. Lol jonanna x
