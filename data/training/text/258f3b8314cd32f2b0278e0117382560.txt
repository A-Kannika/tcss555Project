says \Mizzou 37, Illinois 9...suck it doubters!  It's gonna be a fun year.\,No, 'he' is not out there.  No, I do not want a \local gay romance.\   Facebook ads blow...hard...and badly.   So, I guess I don't need one of those either.   Thanks for the service, facebook?,is confused by facebook ads. They want me to find a gay date, gay room mate, local gay romance, and hot man. They also want me to get SWAT training and build muscle, while playing lots of computer games, buying cheap apple products, removing almost all my hair, drinking vodka, watching dumb short films, and getting a koosh tech job. What are you up to, facebook?,is through one family thanksgiving...now the boozies' turn begins.    One of these days I secretly hope our after dinner activity is a game of beer pong.,is...break can not come fast enough.   Anyone remember the days when break actually meant something, instead of 300 tests to grade and 600 or so grades in total to enter?  What we call break pales in comparision.   I miss kindergarten..
