It's 4am, I'm been up for more than 24hrs and I still can't sleep :(  Insomnia sucks.,I found Mt Dew at spar and was SOOOOOOO excited.  Then I tried it and it's a crappy British version that just tastes like sugar water.  Why do they get my hopes up like this? :(,Here is a clip of Sam singing a song on an old guitar with strings that needed changed over a year ago recording both guitar and vox with the same mic.  Something I like about the raw nature of this kind of thing but I'm sure Sam is still going to kill me for posting it.\
