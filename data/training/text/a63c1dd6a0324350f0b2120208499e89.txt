My family celebrated the 85th birthday of my Dad together at Allegany State Park in NY yesterday. He passed away last November. Honoring his wishes we spread his ashes in a place dear to his heart. We miss him!,Every person has 1000 wishes. A cancer patient only has one: to get better.,They say true friends go long periods of time without speaking & never question the friendship. They don't hold grudges. They understand life is busy but you will always love them. Re-post if you have at least one of these friends. You know who you are. ;)
