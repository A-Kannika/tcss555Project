got some sleep last night, and now I think that monster energy drinks are made of energizer bunnies,It's still too hot here in the south!! Wish someone would do something about. Guess I can't whine if I don't do it myself. I'll take over the world and then make this place colder. Or just move. Anyway, weekend was way too short,It's so hot today that we got out of training. An unprecedented 120 degrees. So i've been just chilling,I got a alot on my mind. This week has been especially stressful when it comes to getting back home. I have 7 more weeks here in Mississippi, and then I'm off to home.,burnt my mouth on french bread pizza,I passed another test after an all nighter. I'm beat. Phew. Calling it a night,Has been playing BlazBule all weekend long. I need to get out.,the longest most boring weekend just happened at my place.,I want to know what everyone is doing right now! Tell Me!!,It's been a long week, hope to just sleep ...ZZZ,Had an awesome time in Florida this weekend. No time to share photos, will do
