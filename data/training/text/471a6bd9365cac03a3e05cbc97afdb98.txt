saw the sun for the first time in a week today,Check out my new room, it's Rat-free!!,is pleasantly surprised,thermostat doesn't work and heating is on full blast. Just checked room temperature and it's almost 95 degrees,is contemplating pulling an all nighter,is sick at an inopportune time,my endoplasmic reticula are taking a beating,The last final is always the hardest one to study for,is in hibernation,I need collimators in front of my eyes to prevent my attention from scattering,it's Festivus for the rest-of-us. Commence the airing of grievances.,just saw a rabbit leap 3 feet in the air to avoid getting hit by a car,is tired,is watching Olympic curling,my cell phone survived a ride in the washing machine AND the dryer with but some superficial injuries,Classes are ... over?,misses playing racquetball,4 finals in the span of 26 hours is exhausting. Off to bed.,I have observed that everything looks more delicious when wrapped up in aluminum foil. I wonder if this is Pavlovian response to take-out from Chipo
