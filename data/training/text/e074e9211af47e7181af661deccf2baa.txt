Life begins from today ! :) Can't believe I've set up this account,Thanks for all the support friends during this period to all my friends :) especially 4E1 :),Storm in a Teacup... Life is a whirlpool of emotions...,How's life people?,Life is amazing... just watch it grow....its tough though,Light Out the Darkness,Yay! I finally started baking :),Treading on a different path. Life will never be the same again.,Finally out of one living hell.....,I'm now planting a trailing watermelon begonia/ Rainbow Vine :) Aww plants...,Life is full of coincidences...,Within every desire is the mechanics of its fulfillment... If you have the aspiration to be something, it is because you have the potential to manifest what you are seeing....,\Do not ask me: 'Why do you love me?' for such a question would invite a response of conditional love. I do not love you because you look a certain way, think certain thoughts or practice certain virtues. Only ask me this: 'Do you love me?' That I may answer: 'Yes, oh YES!'\,Those posts
