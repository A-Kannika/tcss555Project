My Dean Martin album is dusty and staticy. This upsets me greatly. Stupid used record shop, not cleaning their vinyl before they resell it. :P,Trying to practice for The Wedding Singer auditions... by singing Once On This Island songs? Not even remotely close song styles, but hey, it's still Broadway, ain't it? :P,Two firsts at the orientation: \Ball\ was referred to as a \normal last name\ and I was told that I was \not happy enough\. :o,\just stay away from the rice cakes, darlin'!\,*kicks facebook chat in the face* ... I think it's broken now...,\is chillin' with her homies\, \Fiona! You are not, and never will be gangsta, so stop trying!\ sleep deprived children will be sleep deprived children :),Just finished Howl's Moving Castle. Hmph! That was the only thing defending me from the evils of boredom. I guess I'll have to rely on the kind charity of my friends now. Oh God, this won't end well. :p JK, ily guys. <3,\You can tell me it's coincedence, but I won't believe you\,Some people are just a**holes. For
