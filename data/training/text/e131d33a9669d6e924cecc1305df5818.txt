Too many people are suffering right now.,Another beautiful day in Tx 75 degrees, went to the park with the kids and hubby, now time to finish cooking my ribs, feed the family, give the kiddos a bath and spend some time with the love of my life.  Gotta love the family life :),Homeless go without eating. Elderly go without needed medicines. Mentally ill go without treatment. Troops go without proper equipment. Veterans go without benefits that were promised!! Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first!!!! 1% will re-post and 99% of the people on Facebook won't ha
