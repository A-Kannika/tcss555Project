just wondering why the ex wife does not allow my kids to send me a fathers day card in the mail?hmmmmmmm grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,is hoping and praying that my best friend is doing okay in the hospital,mind blank can not think of anything,had a wonderful visit with a very special person with a very special place in my heart and now all is right in my world love u,so i should have figure this one out.legal aid will no longer help single dad's get the rights to their own children.that is bullshit.and yet again i am screwed out of my kids thanks legal system,life is a lemon and i want my money back,just sitting thinking that maybe my dad should watch what he says to me because of him i have no trust with the church.maybe he should practice what he preachs because i'm pretty sure that he has no right picking up a rock and throwing it,is hoping that my money is in soon or there is a chance that i could be without a home at the end of the month,another fathers day without my kids.bullshit,Where you don't want to wake u
