SOOOO!! Frustrated right now!!!  Been in the studio trying to dance it out for over an hour and it still didn't work.  Lord give me the strength!!!,It's such a shame when you try to be a good friend and people take that for a weakness.  I'm starting to believe that people are trying to push me to acting ignorant!!!!,Don't know how I did it, but I got the baby's diaper bag in my car and my purse is still at home.  Hope I don't get pulled over on the way home. :(,Sooo much to do!! So little time to do it!!,I know the good book says \Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your  heart\  I just pray it doesn't take a whole lifetime for my desires to be fulfilled.,Back at work today!! I sooo wish I was anywhere else!! Is it Friday yet???,Family time!!!! Off to the movies we go!!,I'm at Work about to pull out all my hair!  I've been on a call with a customer for 2 1/2 hours.  OMG!!!!,I know I'm like 3 days late, but I want to thank everyone who wished me a happy birthday!!!!
