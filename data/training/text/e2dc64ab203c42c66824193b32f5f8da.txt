Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too.,Don't go for looks, they can deceive. Don't go for wealth,\
even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you\
smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day\
seem bright.,“Be the change you want to see in the world.”\
\"Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love.”\
“Nobody can hurt me without my permission.”\
“There is nothing that wastes the body like worry, and one who has any faith in God should be ashamed to worry about anything whatsoever”\
“We must become the change we want to see.”\
“An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.”,You mustn't overcompensate for a basic incompatibility between you and another person. At times it is a fact of life that certain personalities just don't click. Don't bend over backwards for something that is probably only going to be short-lived anyhow.,I'm scattered every where."
