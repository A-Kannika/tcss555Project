I lose internet connection now after midnight, so going to stop talking then...,okay, so I was going to go to bed way back 6 hours ago, and spent the whole time reading fmylife.com and band jokes with my sister...,So now I'm at UNT... so much fun. Didn't count on the lack of three prong plugs, but otherwise is all good.,Thanks to those who have already said it, thanks to those who will now, its good to be 18 I guess, doesn't feel much different... At least I have the ability to vote now.,I am impressed by the variety of people that are now trying to talk to me, or at least in some fashion keep up with me... For some its sad what four years does to even my usually reliable memory...,schenectedly bestrode. What the heck... the first isn't even a  word, but that is one of the two words things I had to type to send a request. Going to try to find a use for that phrase now.,Going to head back to game night, be back on later. Hope to have something to do this weekend, other than homework.,Ugh.... so tired,
