Being in Schotland, probably without internet...,Still in Scotland... I already took a lot of pictures so I'll post them when I get back. I'm using the internet of a local library in Crieff.,Back in holland after after 6 hours on the boat. It's kinda strange to drive on the right though.,At school (tussenuur),Vakantie...,Snow ^.^,I've got a plaster cast aroun my right arm (for the Dutch people: Mijn rechterarm zit in het gips.) Oh and guess what? I'm supposed to go snowboarding like, tomorrow. So that's not gonna happen :( I'll probably still go skiing, but no snowboarding for me this year.,*Mysterious music playing* So, you might wonder why there is mysterious music playing.
