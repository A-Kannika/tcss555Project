Had a lovely anniversary complete with flowers and the melting pot.,What a take your breath away, melt your makeup hot day.,For some reason Michael Jackson dying makes me sadder than I would think. It's like the end of an era. Makes me feel old somehow.,Nothing much to say on this dreary, rainy day...,Can't believe my vacation is over and I have to go to work tomorrow.  All goods things must come to an end...,Time to get packing!,What I brought back from our trip: Some kind of rash on my arms, stomach problems, 2 suitcases full of dirty clothes, lots of pictures, a few souvenirs, some sterling silver, and 3 bottles of duty free liquor.,Mike and I survived the trip and didn't drive each other too crazy along the way.  Had a great time in New Orleans and our days in Mexico.,Is going to hang out with all of her girls for the last time before 2 of them move to Dallas.  (Angie and her family will be heading south this week due to a job transfer.),Is really glad the end is in sight!,I really need to get to bed earl
