I don't want to be hostile And I don't want to be dismal But I don't want to rot in An apathetic existance,And into the eyes of the jackel i say ka-boom  now we begin descent, to where we've never been  there is no going back, this wasn't meant to last  this is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve  and she will never learn bye bye, baby goodbye,cant sleep. Keep rolling on my side with cuts on me.... But I played well so totally worth it!,Hands so dirty you need bleach to clean them.,The world that circles around me could benefit from silence.,\I am made of shamrocks, I am made of stern stuff I am never enough, I am the forgotten child\ #smashingpumpkins,There is no you there is only me....,La Roux is a Slag,To everybody who wished me Happy Birthday thank you all..... except Al cause he forgot lol,12 Trophies in God Of War in less than 24hrs.....? I do actually have a life believe it or not,Im in the sky tonight, There I can keep by your side,Another day is another way.... But not another reason to continue!
