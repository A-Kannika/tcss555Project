What is the meaning of life,Im hot dusty and covered in saw dust but I have a pint,draw some pictures of cells, atoms, molecules, electrons, protons etc then draw a simple diagram of are solar system. notice any simarlaities. So when you look into the night sky are you looking at the cells of a much larger being that we are all part of ,feelin like shit, first sunny days wev'e had in weeks and all I want to do is sleep.,what is the point of all these usless gifts? I mean what is it all about? Why send sompne a gift that they can't do nothin with exept look at its picture and say 'a nome pulling a mooner'  Its not even a real nome. if it was I would smash it. but thats not the point. why do we send gifts to people that they dont want, cannot use and couldnt give a shit about. have are lives got that mundane that as a society this is,why in are society do we segregate everything into seperate boxes. we cateragise people into groups. sepereate nature into field of wheat, a field of cows etc. everything in nature
