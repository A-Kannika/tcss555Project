Back from camping.  Almost died in the river; perhaps kayaking isn't my thing.,Got some sleep.  Feeling better.,is watching the Watchmen.,Foot seems better.  Cautiously optimistic...,Back from work and my ankle is mysteriously killing me!  Ouch!  Oh well, at least I have a day off to let it heal.,Had a great warm up practice this morning for a day full of playing music. Looking forward to the B-BQ/jam and later on a middle-eastern drum lesson/jam/dinner party.,Ok, so I must admit, I'm liking some of the facebook features, and my biggest reasons to not use facebook have been dismantled.  Getting more interested in this.,OK, too many 80's quizes for one night; I'm cutting myself off.,Doing better.  Eventually got awake and in a better mood.  Then had a good, but very busy day at work.  Now I'm ready for my week off! Woohoo!!,My stylus is working!  Ah...Wacom bliss.  SO tired of trying to make art with a potato.,Groggy and grumpy. :(,Ah...Having a good week at work, making good progress on my current sculpture.
