I friken love the high from running!,I really like Dr. Seuss.  This quote from the good doctor is perfect for Mondays. \Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.\,Bought a bike yesterday and rode it for a couple hours around town. I forgot how much fun San Luis is on a bike!! Except now my ass is ready for an ice bath!!,Fantastic Sunday, excellent weekend! Had a revisit with Big Sur Marathon taking off a full hour from my first visit in '06 turning in a 3:52.  Very Stoked! A little dip in the river and a visit to The Nepenthe for a little cocktail and conversation.  I should do this every weekend!!!,Football!!! i love football, football starts today and will go everyday!!!! yeah football!!!
