I understand about indecision, But I dont care if I get behind. People livin in competition, All I want is to have my peace of mind.,Man, I get better looking every day.,So I got a call this morning from housing.  Apparently my roomate-to-be felt uncomfortable having a junior as a roomate and switched rooms.  I now have a double to myself.  She said they don't expect it to be filled.,I got me a ticket to the miami game for labor day...now i just need to wait in line forever to pick it up.,So I've been bowling for a year now, and for the past two weeks I've been bowling a 180+ average.  I should be making money off this somehow...at least more than the $1 I get per win against my Granny when I beat her.  I wonder if you go to hell for trash-talking your Granny in a bowling alley...,Got a roomate.,My computer has been blue screening all day, and I can't call dell until classes are over at 4pm.  I garuntee they tell me to uninstall Vista and reload it.  DAMN YOU BILL GATES!,My bags are packed.  I'm ready to go.
