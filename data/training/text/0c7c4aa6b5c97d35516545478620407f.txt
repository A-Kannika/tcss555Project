might be killing brain cells by just being in her work-place. Two of the air-conditioners are spewing out fumes! One in the main classroom and one in the reception area. Gone.,is writing mind-numbing cover letters for her brother and isn't getting paid for it. The joys of serving your family.,is glad the weekend is here.,was just told that she looks \dasyat\ and has killer eyes. Having heard that, Yasmin goes on to wonder why she still is single and then she is reminded of the fact that she looks \dasyat\. Fabulous.,feels quite good knowing that people think her language school is better than the 'so-called-well-known' ones. Now, just send your kids to me.,totally did not realize that it was 4th of July. It must be absence of fireworks and barbeques and chilled beer. lol.,loves teaching. It's the only thing that brings her true joy. Yup, even when the students behave like demons and apes.,is enjoying this quiet Friday afternoon with FEIST and the stormy winds outside.,is glad she has people who care about her
