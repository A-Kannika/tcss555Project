My house got broken into by teenagers. They took my dvd player and toys my kids have had since they were babies. Neighbours on 2 sides of the complex saw who walked away with the stuff so I KNOW EXACTLY WHICH KIDS DID IT.,Happy Birthday to my Baby Girl!,kookoo for Cocoa Puffs!,Thank God  its the weekend.,What will today bring?,Played fetch with the cat today. LOL who would have thought?,I hate the flu,MMMMMM wouldn't you like to know....,DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long. Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression. Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour? Most people won't, but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will... suffer at some point in our lives. Show your support, good people:),Thank you all for the birthday wishes :)
