is exhausted from a crazy day!  I am pretty sure that I could really use a nap...but I have too much to do!!,is looking forward to SHARK WEEK!!!  I can hardly wait!,is thinking that it sucks to get blamed for something that you didn't do!  Wouldn't it be nice if people could just own their actions and not resort to using innocent people as their scapegoats!?  Seriously!,is wondering if the cost outweighs the benefits?,looking forward to another busy day in the sun tomorrow!  We are gonna have a good Tuesday.....bring on the coffee!!,had an enjoyable movie night and now headed to bed early...busy day tomorrow!!!,needing to make time to go see either The Collector or A Perfect Getaway....or maybe both!  Now I just need to get the time......,is wondering if that's better now?  Does that work?,had a great time visiting with friends tonight over dinner!,is in major need of a nap!  Life has been keeping me too darn busy!,is cooking dinner for the guys tonight!  Getting a late start, but I don't hear any complains!
