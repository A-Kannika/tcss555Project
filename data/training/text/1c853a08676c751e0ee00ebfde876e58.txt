Love. Dream. Inspire. Headbang. <3,I was harrassed long enough... I finally gave in. -__- New pictures up. <3,enjoys eating soft tacos. <3,I believe the sun should never set upon an argument, I believe that junk food tastes so good because it's bad for you. I believe in karma, what you give is what you get returned. I believe you can't appreciate real love 'til you've been burned. I believe the grass is no more greener on the other side, I believe you don't know what you've got until you say goodbye. <3,2010's almost over. :O The year flew by!,Hey Sexy Lady- Shaggy ;),Dyed my hair yesterday. :D,likes how Krysten and I are so easily swayed. Once high school's over she'll have crabs on her eyebrows and genital warts, and I'll have herpes and be addicted to crack. O:,Peppermint tea and House. <3,Dance there upon the shore; what need have you to care for wind or water's roar? And tumble out your hair that the salt drops have wet; being young you have not known the fool's triumph, nor yet love lost as soon as won,
