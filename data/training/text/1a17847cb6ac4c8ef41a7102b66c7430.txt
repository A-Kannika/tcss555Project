Needless to say, he is not happy!,coughing up a lung is not fun.   It is now a tickle in the back of the throat.  Is there a remedy for that?  Janet, any suggestions?,The weekend begins!  I am oddly misplaced in my house...sitting still now for twenty minutes w/o having to look around to see what the kids are doing.  I'll miss it tomorrow I know.
