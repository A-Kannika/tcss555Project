Hvala puno na cestitkama svima redom! Zivili! \\m/ :D,A raven came to me, spoke to me in my dream A long lost prophecy, a forgotten legacy Echoes of yesterday, won't let these dreams fade away All the beauty I adored, at the edge of the world,Tomorrow will take us away Far from home No one will ever know our names But the bards' songs will remain Tomorrow will take it away The fear of today It will be gone Due to our magic songs,I am truly left alone, but somehow... just somehow, it feels like my loneliness is a victory over the self-delusion of joy... and hapiness.,What if when they saw burning stars They thought it was a gift from beyond far Look close between the lines Beyond what you believe to be real Are they just theories of time.....,Oden! Guide our ships, our axes, spears and swords, guide us through storms that whip and in brutal war!,Oden! Guide our ships\
Our axes, spears and swords\
Guide us through storms that whip\
And in brutal war!!!!!!! \\m/,Innocent people suffer the loss\
Your broken hope so clo"
