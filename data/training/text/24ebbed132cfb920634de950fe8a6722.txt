\Be Yourself, No Matter What They Say\....,Success is not measured by what you gain in life ,\
 its measured by How You influence life,there is no Grey area only Black or White \
One must choose the Right Path,???? ?????? ????? ??? ???? ????? ??? ???? ???? ?????? ??? ???? ??????  ?? ???? ??? ????? ?????,bad things happen to good people,There are times a person must not be so flexible.........,GOD Why cant i enjoy life like everybody else ?,I kissed Death Today But God is My Guardian Angel\
 saving me everytime,I feel like im in a Lion Den I cant turn My  back to anyone,Come as you are ,as you were , as i want you to be,What a day I feel like im damned,Once You Know Your Limits You Can Go Beyond Them,One have the right to choose what he wants and who he wants"
