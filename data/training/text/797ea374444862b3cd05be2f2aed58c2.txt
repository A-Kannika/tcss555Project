still getting it together!,Is there anybody out there?,Can't seem to find anyone from old school days and nursing training!! It would help if I could remember names. Time to drag out some memorabillia to refresh the memory.,I finally had a day off & the house to myself. I so enjoyed pottering around putting things to right again after being away for weeks.  Had my farewell to Cas Lodge drinky poos last night----great night! just wish I hadn't drunk so much! Won a meat tray which was exciting!   A friend is varnishing & oiling the back deck. Can't wait to get my gorgeous deck back, & find homes for my new ornaments from Thailand.,would love a chat with some old friends. Is anybody out there?,ritual in place! coffee & facebook! Working at 12-just time to pack a box or two-the excitement of moving! Paul & I really don't feel its real yet. Each having odd moments of panic! Usually about money & work! I think I'm panicing less than before-that is until I realise he is!,Well I've learn't a few more tricks. Hope you
