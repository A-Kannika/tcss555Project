Horray for the beginning of the rest of my life!,has cold feet.,is terribly confused. It feels like my mind is warring with itself...,is thinking hard and excited for her new Xanga layout!,thinks pipe tobacco is way better than cigarettes.,doesn't know how to cope with all of this stress... I think I've cried about 10 times in the last 3 days...,continues to befuddle herself.,was NOT able to push her wedding date back to the fourth of September. The presiding judge was full-up. The date remains August 28th at 4:15.,is sick.....still. And possibly jobless in 2 weeks. That is, if no more positions open up for me at Wal-mart.,hopes that wal-mart hires her, now realizing her blouse was open during part of the interview.,maybe a kitty would be a good christmas gift for Connor....,still getting over that cold from last week
