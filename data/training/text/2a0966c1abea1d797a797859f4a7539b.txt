\With your feet on the air and your head on the ground, try this trick and spin it, yeah. Your head'll collapse if there's nothing in it and you'll ask yourself...where is my mind?\-Pixies,Just got a Facebook. Yay,This has been a rather bi-polar kind of day,Your breath fills me with life. The beat of your heart fills me with joy.... I hope that never changes.,You never know just how much your fam(ily) means to you, until you notice that they really are gone...,\Don't cross a bridge, or peak around the corner until you're there.

I love
