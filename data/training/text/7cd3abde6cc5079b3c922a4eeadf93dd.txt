Had and awesome night watching trueblood with friends, time to go vist UH tomarrow and see about joining.,So amny quizes. Sorry everyone, I get bored sometimes.,Is day dreaming about world conquest. One of these days I'll motivate my lazy ass to do it.,Just witnessed a fabled Corey meltdown, and I am trying not to laugh my ass off.,I'm really loving life right now. Awesome friends, fun loving chicks, and my new work out packt with Jason is really working out. My self esteem is at an all time high, just in time for Ren. Fest. They aren't going to know what hit them up in Magnolia this year!,I bought my first domain today. Woadraiders.com is born. Time to start building my empire.,I'm looking forward ot my work out tonight. I think I have reached to point where I feel off if I miss a session. I'm already fitting into old jeans, and I can see my quads when I look down!!!!! I haven't been able to do that since highschool.,So thats what it feels like to be rear-ended in a car-reck. Not an enjoyable experiance. Gue
