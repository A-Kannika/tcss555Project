What a way to close out  Fathers Day, watching Sponge Bob with  Sarah. As soon as she goes to sleep I am taking in a movie.,Strikeforce tonight. Wow! Gilbert Melendez is  back. Mousasi is for real.,Spots for the Fantasy Football League are Filling up. Better sign up soon. Hint hint Kevguy!,I must be going. The soon will be set soon. Time for Kabbalat Shabbat.,Just finished making a batch of my famous salsa. Little bit of Serano, little bit of Habenaro, and lots of Thai peppers. Just the right amount of hurt!,Camping  with family. A little wet and cold. But fun!,Watching the Jets and Dolphins game. Go Dolphins!!!,So how do I earn or purchase a plan on Mafia Wars? I am kinda stuck at the moment.,Watching the latest Acorn video on Fox News. This is unbelievable!,I now know that without my wife hanging over my shoulder giving me the answers I am pretty bad at Word Twist.,Thanks all for the Happy Birthday wishes. It was a very nice birthday!,Song of the Day: Nachamu Ami from Neshama Carlebach,Broncos up by 1. Thin
