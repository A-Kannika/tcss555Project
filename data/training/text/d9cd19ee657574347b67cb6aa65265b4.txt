Just wishin he would have left me the hell alone last June.I was doin just fine w/out him.I was actually happy with someone else.But,unfortunately for me,he didnt.And I,like a freakin idiot,made the worst mistake of my life and married the man who has done nothin but make my life miserable(with the exception of a few nice gestures and occasional special moments)since the day I told him I was pregnant with his child.
