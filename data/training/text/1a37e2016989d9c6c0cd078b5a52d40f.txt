I had so much fun and felt so much love from my baby.,So I messed up and made my baby mad at me so I got her favorite foods and a dozen roses and tried to have a picnic ready for her when she showed, but then it had to rain. So I had to move to the indoors. She still loved it and now everything is fine in the world again.
