KKRs back !,in training,Vacation begins !,Had a great time meeting with my old friends.,A lazy sunday evening ahead .,Enjoying my hard earned week off.,messi on a high,In love with the World Cup Theme Song \ Wavin Flag\.,IPL is finally over.. Awaiting T20world cup.. Thats goin to be a lotta fun ..,A new hectic week ahead !,Change is not always bad,There is something about Anushka Sharma (Band baaja baraat fame)...,Its tough to keep ur mind diverted to other things while ur having a stomach upset...,Do u think Saurav Ganguly will attract a final bid ??,In life is there anything beyond volume & accuracy?,Getting bored ! Need to party....,Finally respite from the heat for all Kolkattans.. Rain Gods finally smiling over KOL....,Watching walk  talk with Bill Gates,Awaiting Layla.....at least it would bring some respite from the heat.......,Finally something to cheer about !! Happy with whatever I got...,Missing Pune..at this time of the year Pune is the place to be...,Overslept and missed my early morning  match.,
