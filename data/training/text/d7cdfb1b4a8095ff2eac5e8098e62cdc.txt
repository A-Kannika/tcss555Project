Dear FB friends: next week Gov. Patrick will announce huge cuts to the Mass budget which will include slashing the funding for services to adults with developmental disabilities UNLESS we let him know that it is unacceptable to harm the most vulnerab...le adults in our communities. PLEASE call the Gov's office 617 725 4005 and relay the message that funding for DD services MUST NOT be cut. THANK YOU!!!,is just a bit fed up with the rain. I know I just came from the desert, but this is ridiculous.,has found a circle of hell, and in it there is a very tired baby who rolls around in the middle of the night, playing and talking and repeatedly waking his parents up by grabbing, slapping, kicking and pinching. For. Hours. To the crib with you, demon!,can't remember squat lately.,wants to wish all the dads out there a Happy Father's Day!,& Tim have just realized that while we have had a blast for the last 3 years, it has been extremely busy and crazy and we're going to lay low for a while and not make any huge plans
