im tired,Bored As hell,im gettin my permit monday,I broke my foot,I'm under house arrest,The 4th of july is an abomination for a holiday.,I fly the beast made of steel,Thick knives that cut the night,Gas tank is filled with vengeance,Machine guns shooting spite,Can't find the thing that makes this,Thing take a hard turn right,I follow where it leads me,Blind bats with wings of might,\
You, will most likely die,From the hands of my arm,When I come and fly and,Take off your face,With the front of my hatredcopter,Gasland is a good movie,Kill the OrcsSlay the OcrsDestroy the Orcs\
You returned late home that nightEvidence all around you from the fightYou see your family's blood spilled on the groundThere's no trace of the Orcs to be found\
Take the broadsword in your handFollow the Orcs to their campYou will have vengeance in bloodWith their heads they will pay the price,got my new phone,you still cant beat pizza,pizza,so freakin bored,or maybe some doritos,Spongebob movie,Dead I am the one, Exterminating sonSlippin"
