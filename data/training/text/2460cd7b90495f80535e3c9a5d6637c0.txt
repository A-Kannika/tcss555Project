feels blessed and likes naps,Busy day..... had to go to a road-show for work. That kinda put a damper on stuff that I needed to get done.... oh well, it's just a speed-bump. I have apple cider so it is all good, yummy!,Yaaaaayyayayayaa!!!! What a great day full of great thing plus; I didn't have to get up at 3am! Bwahahahahaha. I am going to get housework done, write, and make things with my hands - awesomeness!,\And someday you'll know that nature is so, this same rain that draws you near me, falls on rivers and land, on forests and sand; makes the beautiful world that you see....\,\Come live in me all my life, take over. Come live in me and I will rise on eagle's wings\,Getting homework done. Start the new job hours tomorrow - early jay-bird!,sometimes I feel like laughing for no reason at all....,Good day... I went swimming for the first time in a very long time.... I have missed how it feels... almost like flying, I imagine....,is looking forward to tonight,a day off from work, time to get things done and
