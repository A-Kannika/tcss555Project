Hahaha.,My keyboard is acting all wonky...,How the heck did I do that?! The frickin' video?! All I did was listen to the song and now it's doing that. Posting videos of the songs I listen to and whatnot.  I probably accidentlally clicked something. Hmm. It's a cool video though. There are ballerinas and Kate throws glitter at people.,Bleh, I have no fricking life.,Well, I have reason to believe my cat is possessed by demons.  YAY.,Last night I had a dream I was in the Sex Pistols.  Sid Vicious was somehow back from the dead and John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) changed my name to Nikki Nonsense.  It was somewhere on the nexus between totally awesome and scary as hell.,Sick of kitten already. Well wait, no, I'm sick of everyone gushing over it. \"Ahh, she meowed!  Ahh, she pooped!  Ahh, she's walking!\"  Yep, cats do that stuff.,SPELLING OF \"OMELETTE\" FAIL...,I have a hole in my finger from a killer ruler :(\
