Going to Hawaii next month!!,Woo Hoo - Hawaii here I come again!  Day after tomorrow~~~Still have to pack, though~~,It was so fun!  We went on a pineapple plantation and picked our own pineapple's, did a submarine ride, swam, ate lot's of food.  I took the girls where I went to school one year and to my grandma's house.  They really let that go, it was sad.  I actually knocked on the door and asked if I could see the backyard.
