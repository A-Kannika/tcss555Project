What a hindrance, what a pain, To find myself in love again. I hope its lust confused with joy, For I can never have this boy. My youthful heart is too easily won, I hate how this game is never fun. For the outcome is always the same, I'm alone in my feel,is hateing life and everything about it,was fired from mcdonalds on hear say... they could not prove what i suppsoley did.... oh well i'll miss half of the people there,cant do nothing right... cant find a job... there goes christmas,i'll be back in ohio this weekend (sigh) got to go to pizza and try and get a job there and everywhere else. so i can pay off student loans. and get my licens back... anyone have a small car i can use so i can take my test again? but it might be awhile. just thought i would ask to get it out of the way.,now i'm back in lima.. i have no idea what to do.. i have no car, no money and i'm depressed. god i suck at life.,back in lima. nothing to do. nothing to take a shower with and depressed,Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.... tha
