I saw a road runner today. :D and I remembered why I hate my yard. xP,I just covered the outlets in my room with tape ad cut out the little openings with a knife. I just now noticed how dumb that was... o.o;,Listening to Almost Alice, so far I like the songs it has. :D,Dude, so many people have been sneaking up on me lately. D:,Oh look, it's actually raining.,No! My room is a freezer again! >.<,I want to tell you that everything will be okay\

That everything will eventually turn itself to gold,Aw man, I want to play games now, but I don't think that the gamecube or ps2 are set up. :(,Bah, now it's too cold outside. >.<,You all just lost the game!,Wow, today was shockingly fun. :D,I can hear bats from my room, at first I thought it was rats. xP,I shall now dissapear for time unknown to read. Thank you Naruto,I have never felt more sane than I do now, only thing to now is to stop talking to myself. =D,So I didn't get candy or do really do anything today, but I did get to see a giant owl and watch a cool show. :"
