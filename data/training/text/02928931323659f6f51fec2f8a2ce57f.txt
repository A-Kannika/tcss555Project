Trying hard to show grace and mercy...,Giving presenation in class,inserting your own inspired idea --> \Go see inception!\,Just wondering if a werewolf vampire zombies could exist?  What strengths and weakness would it have? And how could you possibly kill this thing?!,A new pastor moved into town and went out Sat to visit his parishioners. \
All went well until he came to one house. It was obvious that someone was home, but no one came to the door. \
Finally, he took out his card and wrote on the back: Revelation 3:20 and stuck it in the door. \
The next day, as he was counting the offering he found his card in the collection plate. Below his message was the notation Genesis 3:10.,Change your stars...,God is good: soooo apparently I am a victim of credit card fraud... a lot of it.\
\
However I was informed through my card company and they happily fixed it in like 30 sec.  This probably could have been a bigger headache."
