To that special someone in my life...I hope you know I love you and if I've been insensitive or unavailable to you...I'm truly sorry from the bottom of my heart. Nothing can make my life more beautiful than you can. I'm willing to tell the whole world how sorry I am, but only care what you think. Please forgive me.
