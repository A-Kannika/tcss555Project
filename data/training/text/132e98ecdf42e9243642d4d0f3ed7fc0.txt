Hehe, I found an e-mail from  June 2009  that I still had to answer. Well, it’s a bit late but I guess the person will be happy to finally get a answer.,at 23h I found out that I forgot to eat this evening. Result: I am cooking chicken with rice and currysauce so that I can eat by midningt :),It’s 2h AM, and I am spending my time on mounting Ants for The European Taxidermy Competition with a pair of tweezers, some insect-pins, a magnifying-glass and a desk lamp. I must be the weirdest friend you ever had ;-),I got bitten by a Hippo today!\

But only a little piece of my skin got taken of and there wasn’t even that much blood coming out, so problem.,I skinned an adult Giraffe today, what have you been up to? :-),Hehe, it says ‘you have 1001 unread  e-mails’.  I think It’s time I clean out my Inbox ;-p"
