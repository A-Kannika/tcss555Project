I am coming home again at Christmass time, can't wait,I am sad, my nanny died.,Coming to Durban , East London and then Cape Town , slow drive starting 23rd dec,happy new year to all,not long to see ti,As a parent we have to live with the way we support and encourage our children.I want like to thank all governments for their input in adjusting our children’s minds. I would also like to thank the Times in the UK for their romantic photographic representation aimed at encouraging young men to join the war in Afghanistan, on your conscience be it!!!!!,To me, this will change the way I think forever. Why should our young go to war, how can we stop them smoking and taking drugs which are fun, and encourage and be proud if they join the army.,I heard women who lost her son at war say \I had no right to make him feel it was alright to sacrifice his life for anyone else, especially in my name\(In Israel),A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.,Coming to Durban Pe and then CapeTown , 23rd dec
