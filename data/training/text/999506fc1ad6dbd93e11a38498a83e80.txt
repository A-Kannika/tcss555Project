you ever have those days where you wake up and just want to punch someone in the face.,oh lordie. i didnt want to buy a bunch of \special\ pregnacy stuff but i need a stability ball. Does anyone around me have one they dont want anymore or are willing to sell it,yay for snow!! <3,Dear Mr. President I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for military starting next year. Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country? While you're at it, lets cut down congressman's pay too. If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay, why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits? Keep it going if you agree,Mocha and waffle time! yummy :),oh emma, why wont you let me sleep,getting ready to go camping. i'll be home sunday afternoon :) have a good weekend all,well, said goodbye to david 30 mintues ago :( it sucks but he'll be home soon.
