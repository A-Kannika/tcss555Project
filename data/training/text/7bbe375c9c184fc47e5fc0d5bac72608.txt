I awoke this morning to some #*!bag stealing all of our almost perfectly ripe asian pears from our tree. mad.,Facebook sort of creeps me out sometimes, maybe.,Stuffed the chicken with a grapefruit. Good idea or bad idea?,Thanks for all the Birthday wishing folks!,Is it true that the fish is done when the eyeballs pop?,Do any of us really know everybody on our friend list? Here is a task for you. I want all my FB friends to comment on this status about how you met me. After you comment, copy this to your status so I can do the same. You will be amazed at the results you get in twelve hours.,Goodbye Portland. Hello Summer!
