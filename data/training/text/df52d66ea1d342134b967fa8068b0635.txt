Gusto ko man tanggapin ang damdamin na yun but the thing is hindi ko sigurado kung handa din ako e. I know mas importante kung ano ang ngayon pero di ko kayang di isipin pati ang kahapon at bukas.lol,I tried to get over with my fave mistakes, and from no where balik ang lahat sa dati, though may bago na me fave mistakes at kahit si greatest mistakes e palaging nabalik...But still, IM ENJOYING IT...lol,For some, its a MISTAKE. But I love the feeling of committing the same MISTAKES over and over again. Regardless how painful it could be.
