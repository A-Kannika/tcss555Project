Psyched to go to Philly tomorrow.  A day off work....Yes!,Picnic time today!!,Gettn ready to watch Sunday night football.  Prolly be asleep real soon.....,Having one of Dawsen's friends over today that he rarely sees.  I am enjoying that he is enjoying himself.,Awesome day!  Dawsen's soccer team won their first game of the season!  Went to see Leah cheer and finished the day off at the good 'ol Denver fair!,Anxious to go to Great Wolf Lodge! Hoping for a great time, although I am sure it will be!,A little late but...to all who wanted to know how it was at Great Wolf Lodge, it was great!  We had a blast!  Worth every dollar and will definitley be going again.   On a more somber note, keeping all the families of the MC boys in my thoughts and prayers.  I can't even begin to imagine the pain they feel.  Praying for healing and peace for each and every one of them.,Hope everyone has a safe and Happy New Year!!
