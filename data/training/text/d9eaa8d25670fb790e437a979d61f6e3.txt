we went to imago gallery tonight for an art opening.  there were some incredible pieces there in every format/mixed media. i caught up with many of my artsy-phartsy acquaintances and dished over the other artsy-phartsy art connoisseurs.  there were paintings with $200k pricetags.  gee...think i'll put one on layaway.  chihuly's work is still there and is pretty (weird) as ever.  dang, he must go thru lotsa windex!,I'm so happy HURT LOCKER took home the OSCARS!! What an amazing movie!  I'm a girly-girl so I don't do guy flix real well but snap, this movie had me velcro-ed (to the screen).  Kat Bigelow...great director.  Those boys gave her their heart 'n soul in their peformances, too.,Today our youngest kitty-kid was \neutralized\.  Her name is \Luxxy Diddler\ and I doubt she'll be diddlin' any time soon!  As I type this, she's pretty much cat-atonic in her somewhat anesthesized condition.  SPAY your kitties unless you want to hear \murr-ouwww\ every other minute every few days!  Diddles, enough already  ;),W
