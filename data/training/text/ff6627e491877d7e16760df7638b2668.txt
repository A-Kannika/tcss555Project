And now you're my whole life,  And now you're my whole world,  And I just can't believe the way I feel about you ... ...Like a river needs the sea, stronger than it's ever been,  We've come so far since that day,  And I thought I loved you then,About midnight, he tells her I ain't got no come-on lines Well I love you, or I'll try to We got nothing to lose but time Stick your hand into my back pocket Light me up like a bottle rocket I just wanna free fall for a while,I've been wakin up to love Every morning, I've been Waking up to love I can hear alarm clocks ringing Through the window all the birds starts singing Every morning we'll be Wakin up to love Don't you know that we'll be Wakin up to love At first I thought ,\I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind. Some come from ahead and some come from behind. But I've bought a big bat. I'm all ready you see. Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!\,is \he pulled that out of a hat. . . he must be a musician.\,alumni game tonight! but brok
