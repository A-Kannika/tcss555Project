If you have the opportunity to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. a lot of people don't appreciate the moment until it's passed....Nothing in life is promised except death.                                                          ,WOW what a weekend i had....back to the basics!!!!,The best way out is always through.,1st day @ my new job....i like it but dang my feet hurtin'.... 8hrs. is not no play thing....just got to skool bout to go learn!!!!,Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.,bout to go grab a bite....and find a job!!!!,\Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.\  ~Bil Keane,im havin' the wrost week ever....1st my car got wreck last friday...& today i broke my phn. @ wrk!!!!UHHHH!!!!,i think im going to ride horses today for the 1st time.....pray 4 me!
