My New Favourite quote!  \If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. It is the principal difference between a dog and a man.\     -Mark Twain,feels it's time to become politically active again,have had A Black Russian Terrier Weekend... excitedly anticipating a Tchiorny Terrier all of our own VERY soon :),keeps forgetting whether he's signed in as Russkiy Toys or Ismisha Cats!!!!,Proud to announce Ireland's first litter of Russkiy Toys,Candy's New mega crate arrived and her blaster & stand is on the way... I love Doghealth.co.uk :),The Blaster is here! Watch Out Candy it's bath time again!!! :D,is fed up with general internet dog forums whose only content seems to be \ooh she's so pretty\ and \Ahhh aren't they cute\... to add insult to injury censorship appears to be the new trend to prohibit open conversation about breeding, talking about your breed, or indeed any intelligent informative conversation.  The Dumbing down of the internet isn't happening...it's already happened!
