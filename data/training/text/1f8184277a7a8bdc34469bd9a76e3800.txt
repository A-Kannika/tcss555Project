Wondering if I want to go out tonight or not.,About to take the kids to Centennial Park for the 4th and the fireworks.,About to start on this d@mn classwork. Hate this class with a passion but I need it to get my degree. GOD!!!!!!!!!,Can't seem to focus on my classwork, no matter how hard I try. I've been staring at this screen for three days and I'm still pulling a blank.,Listening to music and chillin'. I'm still feeling good.,Feeling sad for some strange reason.,School starts tomorrow and the kids go back to school. Thank you Jeevus!!!!!,Still stuck on the assignments that I have due in a few days. My mind can't seem to focus on the work I have in front of me.,Feeling violated. Somebody ate my d@mn Doritos. And I really wanted them too.,I tell you. Facebook is the place to be if you are looking for your relatives and friends. I have relatives that I 've never met and ones that I lost touch with.  This is a true blessing.,Trying  to clear my head and focus on what needs to be corrected or fixed in my life.,
