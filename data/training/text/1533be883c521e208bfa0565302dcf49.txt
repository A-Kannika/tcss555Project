Wish U all a very Happy New Year!!!...........:),A Life Lived In Fear Is Half Lived...!!!,\...Whatever you give a woman, she will make it greater...Give her a house, she will give you a home. Give her groceries, she will give you a meal... Give her a smile, she will give you her heart. She multiplies & enlarges what she is given. So if you give her crap...... be ready to receive a ton of it!! Post on your wall if you agree...\,Delhi, The Capital of India.... is the dirtiest among the many places tat i 've visited!,?????,ME Backkk.....!
