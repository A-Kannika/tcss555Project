Scifi Club meeting at Mai's tonight (7th St. and 2nd Ave., East Village) @ 8pm!!! Please send back if you can be there so we can get an idea of how many people will be there (in case we need a reservation).,Wondering why I just can't shut up before I f up perfectly good  acquaintances, grades, etc? Or at least why I can't think through what  it is I'm saying before I speak?,Happy Commune Day! *Is happily dancing around singing songs from the Commune and the months after it* \Tout ca n'empeche pas, Nicolas Qu'La Commune n'est pas morte!... Ils                        sentiront dans peu, nom de Dieu,                         Qu’la Commune n’est pas morte.\ \C’est la lutte finale! Groupons-nous et demain                        L’Internationale                        Sera le genre humain!\,Just watched Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed.  It's a hell of a lot creepier than the first Ginger Snaps, a lot better too, though I don't think I'm sleeping tonight, thank you very much!,Turns out not to be sleeping tonight anyway.  O
