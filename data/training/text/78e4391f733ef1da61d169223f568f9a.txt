M gonna lose atleast one mark in geometry !,HAPPY DIWALI !!,Ne one watched BLUE ? Is it worth watching ?,For some of my big mouth buddies: At times it is better to keep your mouth shut and let people wonder if you are a fool than to open it and remove all their doubts......,Some things in life make you wait for so long........maybe because that's what is supposed to be,or maybe because you shit on them while they were running...........and u wait so desperately for the time to come that the charm of that something is long forgot
