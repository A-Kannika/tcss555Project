No remorse no repent we don't care what it meant another day another death another sorrow another breath.,Guilty as charged but damn it ain't right there's someone else controlling me, death in the air stuck in the electric chair  this can't be happening to me who made you god to say I'll take your life from you?! Flash before my eyes now it's time to die, burning in my brain I can feel the flame!,Man this sucks finals everyday this week tomorrow two finals and the rest of the week one per day guess I can't complain though.,And emotions are essential to survival, existence but although how cold I sound I mean no offense... Emotions are a cloud that shrowds one judgement behing a smokescreen, and a veil a fog, does this make sense? People lie, yet expect the truth, they kill but expect to live, they sin and expect forgiveness time and time again.... Hahahahaha just saying. Oh and why so serious, these are the things I ponder. :),Turn and run tail hail falls on you, run like hell ..,..... Please forgive meeee!,
