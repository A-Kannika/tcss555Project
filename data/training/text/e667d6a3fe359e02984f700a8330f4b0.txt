I hate being sick,I get to see my fella in less then 2 weeks! Yay!,wondering whether or not I want to attempt to round house kick for Jen...and craving going to see another movie.,up and down all night tonight...wish I wasn't so exhausted I was afraid of missing my alarm.,toured all day yesterday, and now my shows are all muddy from the stupid mud I had to walk in, because it rained the whole time. :(,Looking forward to seeing a movie with Jen tomorrow. Yay life really is back to normal.,loving life again after a year. Yay, Jen is great!,I know I should go to bed now, but I don't want to at the same time. Going to anyway. Tomorrow the real fun begins! Only 6 hours to wait.,wishing something good was on tv late at night. -cartoons again-,I'm really hungry, but too lazy to fix anything. Oh well I guess.,finally able to log in again! How happy!,I should be cleaning the kitchen, but instead I'm sitting at my computer doing nothin,Trying to decide if I want to go out or not...I don't think I will.,Sad that this is
