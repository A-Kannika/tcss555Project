If you agree, join us in posting this as your status the rest of the day.,God there are some MAJOR perverts on myspace...

LOL!,Eat Pray Love is a great movie!!!,Watching Knocked Up I love this movie! It's so funny!!,I was just about to walk out the door to go for my walk when it started pouring rain... Oh well guess I'll just do some yoga.,I can't wait to spend the weekend with my little family! We're going to go get Ben an Easter basket Saturday! Yay!! =) lol.,Haha my family on my Dad's side are the most immature, judgemental people ever... They send me friend requests and obviously see I have a son, so they don't write me back and ignore me... nice! I had to delete them. Now my Grandpa won't have anything to do with me either. Oh well.
