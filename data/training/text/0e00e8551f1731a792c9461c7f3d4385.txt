On the other hand I realllllllllllyyyyyy have to crack down tonight because tomorrow is TEST DAY!!!!!! =],Trying to kick this cold, still feel pretty crappy though.... getting some panelling up today? Maybe... hopefully.,\"We don't live in a world of reality, we live in a world of perceptions.\" Gerald J.
