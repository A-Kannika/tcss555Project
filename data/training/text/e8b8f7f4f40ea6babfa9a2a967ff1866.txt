I'm so pissed, I went five months without thinking about it, but I just lost The Game! GAH!,God I love David Guetta. Might be a little late on this bandwagon, but he's currently my favorite artist.,I hate teh interwebz!,Does anyone know of any good dance clubs in the Akron/Cleveland area?,I'm so excited, I got all sorts of good news yesterday, more good news today, and my day is only going to get better! \The sun on my skin and the world that I'm in makes me delirious\,Thanks ODOT for making my drive home so great, you were really on-top of things and ready for this snow storm. /sarcasm To say the roads were terrible would be an understatement...,Hooray for not being able to sleep!,FYI: When making a left turn you should be in the left-most lane. The guy I hit didn't know this, and attempted to turn left from the center lane when I was in the left lane going straight. MORON! Thank god I had a witness. Pictures of my car coming soon.,Other drivers insurance sent me to a rental company yesterday morning. 24 hou
