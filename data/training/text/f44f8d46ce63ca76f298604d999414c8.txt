What is happening here!,I think I'm more excited than I really should be that Heroes is back on.  And House coming back next week!  No, I'm not a couch potato, I swear!,Note to self: When you're watching Heroes tonight at its new time (9pm eastern!) try not to get too distracted by how much you want to marry Zachary Quinto. End note.,Maybe I'll convert to hedonism. Step one: eat this awesome piece of chocolate. (Don't worry, I still love salad.),Facebook should really add Celibate to the list of relationship status options.,uhhhh...invisible?,I just ate Hagen Daas rum raisen ice cream and I think it made me tipsy. (Yes I ate the whole thing and I wish I hadn't oh god!),Oh my, would you look at the time? I almost forgot this week's gushing about Zachary Quinto! Time to drift off into peaceful dreams about pointy-eared serial killers.,I just had to eat three bananas because they opened up when I tried to pull one off the bunch. I am so full of potassium right now.,How do I get myself into these situations?,Want
