Going to school to work on stuff for the Awards Committe and T & I Cluster Meetings for August Conference next week.  Can't believe that summer break is almost over.  But I'm getting kinda bored, it is probably a good thing, lol.,Just cleaned the carpets.  It is nice and clean but now I'm tired...,Finally getting things ready for school.  I'm so ready for my students!  It is really lonely in Graphic Arts without any learners.  Today we installed the new plotter which takes 60 inch material and prints on heavy items like canvas.  WOW...we are going to have a great year!!!!!,Had a great Speedway Madness radio show this morning with Mike Hoffman on 104.7 The Rocket. I want to give a shout out and big thank you to Dusty Robbins, Natasha Herring and Jeremy Green for being such great guests!,We made it through the races last night before the rain hit, good call Lonnie & James.  Ready for a relaxing and fun Sunday!  Weekends rule, lol.,Had a great Speedway Madness radio show this morning with Mike Hoffman on 104.7 T
