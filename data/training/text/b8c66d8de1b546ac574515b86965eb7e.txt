\If you judge people, you do not have time to love them\  - Mother Teresa,is..Temporarily Out Of Service and in need of repair, but not sure the problem can be fixed...,I wonder why the more you try to do the right thing, the more everything goes wrong?,every\
person has 1000 wishes.  A cancer patient only has one: to get better.  I\
know that 97% will not post this as their status, but I know that my \
friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status, at least for\
an hour, in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still \
...fighting!!,A true friend doesn't care if you're broke, when your house is a mess, about your past, or if your family is filled with crazies. They love you for who you are! A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship. REPOST if you are blessed with at least.........one true friend.,I will now only choose to have people around me that \
enhance my life and see me as a helpful loving person ... one that is not perfect,It's Offi"
