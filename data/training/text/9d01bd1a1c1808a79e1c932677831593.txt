Why are people so insecure? I'm just chill so everyone who has a problem can just get over it :P,i dont understand a lot of things, but i would like to learn.,im seeing things more clearly, and things are clearing up. Somethings take time to fix, and i cant change everything. Life is getting better :),america's next top model!,still up i dont sleep till the sun comes up,this is way better than myspace :),hmmm I had a very calm peaceful day, I wish everyday could be like this. I know I can be immature sometimes, but im young and human. I know I make mistakes, but at least I learn from them :P,I am so hungry right now,hmmm okay today was weird and secrets came out. but things can be deceiving and things are not always as they seem. also one event does not define a person and who they are, it only means they made a mistake.,IM NOT VAIN.,Having fun spring break baby!,Omg!!!! My grades are way better! I am so happy, i have 1 A 3 C's and only 1 F, but its way better than before. Still working hard to make them bett
