English subtitles would be a plus (I just started learning French a few months ago so I'm not exactly fluent.),is so cold right now! Any know of a way to get rid of cold chills? I've tried a hot shower, hot tea, tons of blankets & sitting very close to the gas heater.,Does any one play Warhammer Online? I don't play it but I got a code for free items with a game my brother bought me. Anyone want the code?,So I have auditions in about five weeks and I still can't decide what I'm going to sing for my solo. All of my ideas just seem...bad. Anyone know of any good mezzo-soprano arias or any impressive Hawaiian folk songs?,There's nothing like the new year to make you want to blow your own brains out...,So much to do...... only twelve
