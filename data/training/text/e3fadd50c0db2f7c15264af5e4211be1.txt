WOW! I love facebook chat (insert sarcastic tone). It keeps flipping out on me and saying I'm offline. More then a little bit inconvenient when I'm in the middle of a conversation... Oh well, tech is still not 100% flawless yet, so I guess I should cut th,All the fun people come on in groups of 2. At least lately.,Well now that I've checked to see who wants to kill me for posting pics from high school, I'm heading to bed... just let me grab my sword first.,I got my new phone! I thought that I sent a bunch of people a text so they would have my new # but returns out I sent a bunch of e-mails... oops.,First day of work in over a week. Definitely not something I missed.,I would like to take a moment while it is on my mind to think everyone who wished me a happy birthday (especially the ones from the future).
