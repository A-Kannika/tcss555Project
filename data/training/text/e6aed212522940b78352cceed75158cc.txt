Had a great day with my wonderful husband on his birthday !,Beer pong tonight with people I love.,Today we are going to the lake with some wonderful friends . I know we are going to have a great time .  =),Had a great time at the circus with my man and Lil men . =) Now its back to work tomorrow.,I played the best joke on my kids today. I pretended to hide the eggs and had them come out and look for them but really I put them back in the fridge. After about 15 minutes of them searching for the eggs and not being able to find them I gave in and showed them where the eggs were. That was our payback for all the pranks they played on us for April Fools .  LOL !   Happy Easter !  (='.'=),Hey guys if any of you know of an Asst. manager who is seeking a new position let me know.
