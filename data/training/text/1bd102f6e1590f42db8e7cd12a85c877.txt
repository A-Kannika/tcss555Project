Enjoyed having Callista and Chris here for a visit.  That little Grandson of mine is getting bigger and bigger.. Callista has the pregant walk now.,cleaning house and doing laundry,... YUK!!!!!,Sounds like the perfect day.. Kids.. water and sunshine!,Had fun tonight with Crystal, Josh, Holly & Josh, but really missed Callista and Chris.  Maybe next time.,Bejeweled Blitz.... how can I go from such a high score.. to like 9000.  I mean.. really.. grrrrrrr,Worried about Josh, he had a car accident tonight.. and now he and Crystal have no running cars.  I will try and help him tomorrow as much as I can. Maybe God will send them a car.. Thank God.. He didn't get hurt worse.,I saw him in my dreams again last night.  First time I have seen his face.  He is so beautiful.  Now if we could just get him to be born.. then I can kiss that little face!,Just got home for the evening.. have a half hour before bed.. just want to relax and do something that doesn't involved decisions, or serious thought.,Happy Birthday.. to Pau
