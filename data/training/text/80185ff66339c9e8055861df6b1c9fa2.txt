Watching \Twin Peaks,\ one of the greatest tv shows ever made.  So, so weird.  I'm very excited to get to sleep in tomorrow, all the way until 630am (doesn't sound like much but it's a hell of a lot better than the 4am I've been running since Friday!).,Now I remember why I only go to Summerfest about once every 3-4 years: because it's boring.  Although they've made major changes to the Meyer Festival Grounds, which is interesting; there are so many vendors now you can buy damn near anything.  I was expe,is tired.  Slept well all night and took a long nap today but still not quite fixed up.  I'll just keep chuggin' along; hopefully really awake by the time I see \Bruno\ tonight!,Cut my finger at work and got 3 stitches today.  Was it at 9am?  No, of course not, it was at 520pm.  I'm still taking tomorrow off, f that.,is going to Summerfest today, not for any of the crappy bands, but to hang out with friends from out of town.  Deeply shocked & moved by the loss of MJ, he was a freak but his talent undeniable; h
