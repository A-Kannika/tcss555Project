I miss my new granddaughter...been sick, the two grandkids here and me, so we haven't seen Baby Chloe since forever!! Okay, maybe not that long but too long, plus, it's David's birthday today...a big one! Missing out on that too...at least I went to the doc this time (thanks Lauren and Dina for the push) and got meds...big sigh...,Hidee ho...we had a great Easter...new grandbaby arrived...uh-huh, that's right, new girl in town...and what a cutie!!  I will let her daddy post her pictures though, don't want to take away too much of his thunder...Baby Chloe has arrived!!  We were so blessed and on Easter Sunday...God loves us!!,I love my deck on a day like today..out there, I can feel the crispness of the wind on my face, hear the leaves waving back & forth, I can smell the wetness of the air, the earth; I can feel God..this house is perfect for that, no noisy street just outside, no exhaust fumes, just simple perfection...,Happy Mother's Day to all you mothers...you mothers!!  Especially those in my family...an
