with a need to bleed you when the light goes green\
best believe,\
I’m last to leave, but the first to go, Lord, make me dead before you make me old\
I feed on the fear of the devil inside of the enemy faces in my sights:\

I am a soldier and I’m marching on\

I am a warrior and this is my song,Enjoying Life at IMA.... :),Success is not permanent & failure is no"
