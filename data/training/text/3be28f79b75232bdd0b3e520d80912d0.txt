This is the first time that I've actually been worried about having a job in public education.  I hope that the legislature comes to its senses (RIGHT)!,thinks that the pool is still too cold!  But it didn't stop me from takin' the 1st swim of the season.,I worry for my student both present and former.  I wish for them to live life without pain or regret, but I know that they will face both.  I hope that even thought they have learned little from me on the academic front that I have helped them become successful at life.  I worry.,Is so tired!  Why?  Because teaching people how to recognize prejudice and racist behavior takes a lot of energy.  I know the cause is just, but I wonder if I am making a difference.
