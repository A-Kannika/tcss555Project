\Man, this pepper shaker is so sixteen year old boy with a cheesy moustache.\,Wewt! Helped a freshman stylist cut a woman's hair and the lady loved it so much she gave us each a $10 tip. That's over double the price she paid for the cut. I love generous tippers. =D,I have come to the conclusion that I am nowhere near interesting enough to post my thoughts and activities on Facebook. Darn my boring social life and uninteresting thought process. >.<,The commercials for Insidious are kinda freaking me out and scarring me for life. >_<,I'm so bored of my life it's not even funny. Every time I look into a mirror I feel ugly and I'm always in a funk. The only time I feel good is when I'm with my boyfriend and as soon as we're apart and feel lonely and sad. I'm thinking about going blonde tomorrow just so something in my life can change and be different for once.,Why is it that good men always fall for women with the ugliest personalities?,Thanks to denial I'm immortal! =D,You know what the best thing about ex lover
