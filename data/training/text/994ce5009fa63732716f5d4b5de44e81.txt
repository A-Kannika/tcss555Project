I made 30 bars of soap last night! The house smells good!  Now I have to go to town to run some errands...and get supplies. It's an overcast day but I'm feeling sunshiny on the inside! :) Take Care and God Bless!,Gottta go...4 batches of soap done...if I make anymore, Sarah will have a hissy!  FYI: I have had enough of this rain...about 4\ here, so far. And still no puddles in my yard, gotta love living on a sandhill...not. One day I will have grass...(sigh*),Its a blustery day! Gonna try my hand at indoor gardening starting today. This will be an experiment to see if I can grow mesclin greens and baby spinach in my window:).,Insomnia strikes again... but a least my ear ache is finally gone!,Here we go again...

Today Momma and Thurdsday...Gradma's House!,Argugh...Good morning, I guess. (Yawn)  My baby boy is back this weekend from NCSU, requesting home cooking!
