It was fun arranging a B'day party after long. Celebrated Amoghs 5 yrs Bday on sat ( in advance) since we will be on vacation from this week end. Lots of kids playing around, panipuri and chat on menu,games, good friends at home....it was an enjoyable evening !,Back to office from tomorrow....my God...vacation is over....chalo beta lag jao ab kaam pe !!!!!!,Back home from a long holiday, had a good time in Malaysia. Today was a real rest day ! Just relaxing and lazing. Need to get back into rotine from tomorrow. And yes, I am just excusing myself for not replying to so many  happy new year sms.  I wish all of you a great year ahead. HAPPY NEW YEAR - 2010 !,Wondering if we can take the kids to planetaurium to watch the Solar Eclipse. Special arrangements for viewing will be made there. I am sure they will enjoy it....but seems difficult, its a working day tomorrow. I think Rahul daddy will manage it, I will watch the eclipse from office.,have a long day today, office then followed by official dinner....looking
