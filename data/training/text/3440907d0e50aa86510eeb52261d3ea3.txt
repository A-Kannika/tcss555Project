se viene el fin de semana porfin wn!!!!,a europa x 3 semanas,OFFICIAL: Michael Owen is a red devil!!,Welcome to where time stands still No one leaves and no one will Moon is full,never seems to change Just labeled mentally deranged Dream the same thing every night I see our freedom in my sight No locked doors,no windows barred No things to make my brain seem scarred  Sleep,my friend,and you will see That dream is my reality They keep me locked up in this cage  Cant they see its why my brain says “rage” !!,Cold was my soul Untold was the pain... I faced when you left me A rose in the rain...,Build my fear of what's out there  Cannot breathe the open air  Whisper things into my brain  Assuring me that I'm insane  They think our heads are in their hands  But violent use brings violent plans Keep him tied it makes him well  He's getting better,can't you tell? No more can they keep us in  Listen, damn it,we will win  They see it right,they see it well  But they think this saves us from our hell!!!,good luck boys f
