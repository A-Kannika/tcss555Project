is really chuffed because the immigration people let Nick back in the country (despite him not having the right passport) and that Mackenzie now has her Canadian passport (to match her UK passport). Woo hoo!,only has 13 more weeks to work! (that's 50 long days or 462 hours) - not that I'm counting or anything.,is really glad that at 22.30 - some 3.5 hours after her bedtime - that Mackenzie has decided to go to sleep. Geez!,4 more weeks to work! 4 more weeks to work! 4 more weeks to work! I'm so so so counting them down!,is knackered after a morning at the Zoo with Nick and Mac!,is tired. Mac's back in her cot tonight after lots of trips up to say hi, 3 nappy changes and a request to go in her cot. Guess it's not all plain sailing. However, ONLY 3 DAYS TO WORK!!!,wonders why Mackenzie thinks she needs less sleep than Mummy?,is sick to the back teeth of damned DHL. There's a \strong feeling\ our package has been delivered but \very hard to assume\ certainty. What a load of damned rubbish. What a seriously crap
