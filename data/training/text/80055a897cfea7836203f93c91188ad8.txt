I need to sleep more often...,3-6 inches of snow tomorrow...really? I just bought a new fall jacket...,2:35 left in the game...LETS GO STEELERS!,How am I supposed to finish my readings when Beauty and the Beast is playing on ABC family??,Take home exams cause the following:\
1. My ability to concentrate disappears\
2. My floor becomes a second shelf for my clothes\
3. sleeping becomes optional and not advised,currently doing my work at cosmic cup...I miss lafayette!,Oh I could drink a case of you darling\
And I would still be on my feet,Working late at the office...I feel so middle aged...,Did I screw myself over this weekend?????....ehhhhhhhhh, perhaps,working on a research paper all night,There are 86,400 seconds today, that means you have 86,400 opportunities to be thankful (i.e. there's no excuse if you're not)\
