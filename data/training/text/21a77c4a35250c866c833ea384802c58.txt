thinking ... it sure is hot outside today!,Went to financial peace with Dave Ramsey (week 7 I believe)!!  It was awesome!  I would suggest it to anyone that hasn't already been through it.  I am very thankful that Rhema is hosting it!!!,Warn out from campmeeting ... but it was an awesome week!  I really enjoyed it!,Went to Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University this evening!!!  It is really an awesome class!!,Just got home from Wal-mart yet again.  It's the 5th time in three days!!!  Surely that is it for a while!  By the way, I could tell we were all tired when we stood at the \entrance only\ door waiting to exit for a good 30 seconds before reading THIS IS NOT AN EXIT!,just climbed under the car and fixed my AC (with Cloeys help)! Thank the Lord for good ideas on how to do it!! Wahoo!!,My heavenly father already knows or gives assurance by SEEING the thoughts or clever plan that he plots for me, and it is a plan of peace (the shalom kind of peace) and not of evil (adversity, affliction, etc)!  Jer 29:11,S
