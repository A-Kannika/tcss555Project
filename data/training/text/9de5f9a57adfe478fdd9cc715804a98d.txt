Tell the devil I said \Hey!\ when you get back to where you're from...you smile in my face and rip the breaks of my car...,A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, \
accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow,Your life feels different on you, once you greet death and understand \
your heart's position.  You wear your life like a garment from the \
mission bundle sale ever after -- lightly because you realize you never \
paid nothing for it, cherishing because you know you won't ever come by \
