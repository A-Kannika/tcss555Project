I sometimes wonder why my life always seems to b so difficult & crazy, but then I realize thru it all, I end up being so fortunate to have a wonderful son & the most amazing friends....to all of u I am eternally grateful that u r in my life, and I pray th,I feel terribly sad, lost something precious to me today!,really loathe adults who try to take advantage of their elders by skipping on their bills & using their parents/grandparents credit because they are such screw ups they can't use their own!!!! And the attitude that they are somewhat entitled too!!! grow up people!!!,16 year old sneaks out...partying it up, beer in hand, girls at your side, laughing & being cool......then walks in Uncle Leo.....BUSTED look on the face of shear panic & fright....priceless!!!!!!!,I just love the gossip mongers, first ones to critique someone, but even quicker to spread gossip! LMAO,UGH......... some days should be spent in bed! LOL Thank god I have a Terrific son & absolutely great friends & family....Love you guys!!!!,W
