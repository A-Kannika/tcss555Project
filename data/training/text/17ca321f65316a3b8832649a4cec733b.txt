Thanks everybody!,I finally finished the U of M preliminary \Drinking Safety\ Class. It involved 1 hour of videos you are forced to watch, another hour of flipping through pages waiting for the next one to load (this is without any reading involved), a 30 minute test, and the realization that Mrs. Henretty taught everything necesary to ace it without insulting students' inteligence.,Today I learned in my 101 lab that if my teacher sounds like Ray Romano I will have trouble focusing.
