I have not been at church very much either.  Maybe I can come back one of these days.  I miss my time at church.  The good part about this church is I do not have to come every week for fear of getting in trouble.  If I want to go to church, I will.  If I,I chose not to go to the Monster Bash.  I chose to spend time with my mother and watch the U of L game and the World Series,Thank you for the note and the compliment.  I would like to keep in touch with you even though we live in different cities. Peace.
