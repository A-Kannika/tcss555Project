I haven't gotten mad enough to almost start crying in a long time, but someone managed to make  me that mad. But other than that our show went fine!,Winter Formal tomorrow! Woo! I get to go hang out with my friends on a WEEKEND! Hahaha, it's rare. =)  And for anyone wondering, I did not get a part in Honk!, but I'm gonna go watch it. Especially because alot of my friends that tried out are in it. =),winter formal was sooo fun! =) I got mad at a puzzle for being so frustrating when we took a break haha,Stop food spamming! My gosh, this is getting ridiculous!,I didn't get the call back. But luckily not getting a call back doesn't mean you're not in the show at all. So I'm still hoping!,Can't wait til friday! =),I lost my glasses at school! T.T I hope I find them...I sit in the back of most of my classes,Click the \like\ button if I have ever made you smile in your life. Make this your status and see how many people you made smile. =) By the way, what is formspring and should I get one?,Done working finally... m
