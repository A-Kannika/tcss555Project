Sending postcards from a plane crash,This mamma's got a brand new baby camera. <3,Those flashing liiiiiiights come from everywheeeeere, i just stop and stare. HAPPY NEW YEARRRRRRRRR!!!!,I only want what i cannot have...,Brasov. Tomorrow. <3,Thanks for the memories...,Chestnuts roasting on an open fire\
Jack Frost nipping at your nose\
Yule tide carols being sung by a choir\
and folks dressed up like eskimos\
Everybody knows that turkey and mistletoe\
Can help to make the season bright\
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow\
will find it hard to sleep tonight \

Craciun fericit tuturor! <3,Why try and bust your butt to work on your animation diploma when you can spend the whole day watching Gossip Girl episodes... I'll never change...damnit.,Back to black.,So...I just spent 24 hours awake and i'm still hyper, got drunk at a karaoke bar, sang Rehab by Amy Winehouse. roamed around helplessly at 5 am and now it's 8 in the morning and i'm helping with baking almost 100 cookies...life's sweet <3,work.work.deseneaza.deseneaza"
