was trying to practise my piccolo earlier this evening, with my little boy Daniel in the background trying to teach the cat its numbers and also how to spell! He came into the room where I was practising to look for his flash cards to help her understand! It was very cute.,Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me...... Not quite sure why I'm singing exactly, I've got a hell of a day lined up for my birthday! (no rest for the wicked). On the upside, just got in from Phoenix Concert Band committee meeting and my dear hubby, Alex, has baked me a lovely chocolate birthday cake!,Watched \Enemy at the Gates\ last night and spent most of the film thinking \this music is the same as Schindler's List\. I was therefore fully expecting to see John Williams named as the composer in the end credits and was gob smacked to find out that it was James Horner. How on earth did James Horner get away with such blantant plagiarism?? What is that all about?,Is fed up painting the conservatory now and wishes it would all just go
