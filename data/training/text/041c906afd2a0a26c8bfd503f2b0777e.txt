Will start coming online on Fridays/Saturdays...can't leave drawing board until project finished.,...my mind went blank for a moment there...,One more month. Really got to keep moving.,I'm wondering...where did common sense go? When did it decide to abandon us to a world filled with utter stupidity?,I officially hate religion and politics now. As far as I'm concerned the Age of Reason is a bloodied hoax. Leave me to see in shades of grey 'cause there's no reason for me to see in black and white.,A smooth guy tried to catch me off guard...thank God for the patience and common sense to deal with him. Now its' back to the drawing board.,5 hours of sleep and I'm still kicking it.,Working on website...about to go home and back to drawing up the rest of those pages...,This weather is playing havoc on my senses! I'm praying that the sun will pop up tomorrow^^;,Its' so frigid...love it when it rains, but the wind is too much.,3 hours of sleep and I'm still up...what's going on here? Maybe it was the late night rain t
