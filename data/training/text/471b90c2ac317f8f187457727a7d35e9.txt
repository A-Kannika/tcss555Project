A recent study shows that every princess kisses 12 frogs before finally settling down with her 'Prince Charming' in the 13th shot.. Counting my frogs now.. lol,Massive traffic jams, road blocks, detours of buses, PCR vans, media personnel swarming the campus, processions & demonstrations on the road, mindless naarebaazi, hundreds of guys zipping around in cars, bikes & rooftops of buses and leering at girls.. All in the name of \Campaigning\.. DUSU Elections at its worst.. Thankfully there's no reported violence till now..  Hope i did not speak too soon!!!,Its tough to get back into the routine of daily life after a loooong holiday of 15 days.. I am definitely gonna miss my lazy lazy days.. :(,The real action is in inaction.. Finally understood after 2 long years why 'Waiting for Godot' is a tragedy.. The endless wait, the agony of uncertainty, the meaninglessness of everything around..,Its official now.. I'm in love with Ranbir Kapoor.. :),\The world's most sensible person and the biggest idiot both stay wit
