has just read twilight for the fourth time - too poor to buy any new books!,is a tad lonely :o,Had a laugh last night xD,just parked so badly outside the flat it was hilarious. Luckily mum was driving it home straight after xD,is chuffed that she could finally go out in just a tshirt and not freeze :D,HATES PACKING!!!,is freezing. Doesn't want to turn the heating on because it will cost money, so is bundled up in a fat quilt xD,My cousin Rach is fabulous xD,has pins and needles ¬¬,is tired. Looking forward to a few days of shopping and shows on london next month without having to work ! !,has just moved into her new flat :D,I GET TO KEEP MY CAR xD,is just back from London and is depressed. No more shows! Was enjoying myself :(,Not till I went away to London did I realise how tired I was!!!!!! And still about to pass out any minute ha. But paid today from second job so finally it's worth it (kinda.. :P)!,is getting TOO obsessed with super massive black hole. Must have listened to it at least ten times today..
