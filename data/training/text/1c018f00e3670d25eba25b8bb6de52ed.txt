I discovered last weekend that Wilfred Owen's parents owned the my parents old house! The Owen's moved to Reading after his death - 40 years later we bought their old house! I lived in the house whilst studying him in my 4th year at Secondary School - spooky or what?,About to go trekking in Crete with my brother for two weeks!,Feeling very proud of Richard getting a 2:i in his French degree..........,And a Happy New Year to all old friends and new! \
Just listening to BBC I player  with Jools interviewing Eric Clapton whilst tidying my 7 yr old daughters bedroom!\
Only way to stay sane!"
