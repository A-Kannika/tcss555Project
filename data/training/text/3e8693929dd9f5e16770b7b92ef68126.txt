When you judge others\
You don't define them\
You only define yourself!!!!,hmmmmm... I wonder what I'm thinking!!!!,You know you're getting old when the clothes you wore as a teenager show up in the Halloween store. :),JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED AND CAST THE FIRST STONE!!!!,Night y'all my bed is calling my name ..or maybe its the voices again ... oh well whateva!!   g-nite!,~ Was wondering am i watching to much C.S.I  ? cuz after i shut the TV off  i wipe my finger prints of the remote !!! ~,got to take care of a lot of business and clear up some major misunderstandings... such growth for me!!!!,you know it's only been a year since my Daddy left this world......but the pain of losing him hurts like it was yesterday.....,You don't know what you have until everything you have gets blown away by a tornado or flood waters take it....always remember to be Grateful for what you have....because it can be gone in the blink of an eye....if you love someone tell them today....cause you never know what can happen!!!!!,OM"
