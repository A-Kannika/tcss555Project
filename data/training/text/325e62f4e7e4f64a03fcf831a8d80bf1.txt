is lonely.,is studying to take the NCLEX. Why does everyone hate on wanting to do nothing with your life? Lol. Apparently that just isn't an option.,Had a great night at Trivia with Vicki and the gang.  3rd Place isnt too bad is it? But who was there to help me pick up my spare tire on Southside Boulevard after it fell off from the underside of my truck at midnight? No one. How embarrasing.  Lol.,is it bad that i just want to up and leave? not forever or anything, just want to be somewhere different, experiencing something new, with no plans, no expectations, no responsibility.  i need a vacation.  who is up for europe? australia? any other suggestions? just something new.,2nd Place at trivia.  I hate finding out that there are others out there smarter than me.  Not that that is a hit to my ego, but it's just always nice to have validation of my useless knowledge.  Cant all the trivia questions be science and math related? I wish.  Christa picked up my slack though.  Who else is free Wednesday's at 6:30pm to
