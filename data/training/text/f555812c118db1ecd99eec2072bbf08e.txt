But school is starting.... and thats lame,Why wonlt you tell me???? :(,We hold in our hearts the sword and the faith Swelled up from the rain, clouds move like a wraith Well after all, we'll lie another day And through it all, we'll find some other way To carry on through cartilage and fluid And did you come to stare or wash away the blood?,I am falling down, Try and stop me, It feels so good to hit the ground, You can watch me, Fall right on my face, It's an uphill human race, and I am falling down,AHHHH!!!!! LOOSE COW!!!! And thats why i dont like small towns! hah
