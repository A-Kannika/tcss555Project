They say: don't cry over what is gone, smile about what remains. No matter what it is that you lost, you can still always find value in what is left.,The speed of light is faster than the speed of sound. That's why so many people appear bright...until they speak.,I am afraid the little person with a halo and wings on my right has disappeared. All I am left with is the little red guy with the tail and horns. Uh Oh!!!,Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone, or have been affected by someone who needs a smack upside the head. Lets raise awareness.,Live for today, love for tomorrow, and laugh at all your yesterdays. Never regret the past, always hope for the future, and cherish every moment you have.,Facbook,Says...I am me!  Take me the way I am, or not at all.  I am not here to make anyone else happy, or to be someone or something I am not.  :)
