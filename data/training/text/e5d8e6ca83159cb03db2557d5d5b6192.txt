((OOC:  For the reason of a beautiful PLOT DEVICE, Christine is now normal Christine instead of little 5-year-old Christine.  She's gotta be corresponding to Erik Leverne, after all!)),Bloody typist...So, apparently I'm a vampire for a week.  I'm just glad I don't fucking sparkle.  Then I'd just be a damned faerie.,*slams her fist against the wall* How DARE these advertisements ask me about my \family\?!  Well, I don't have one, I never have, and I never will, so we're doing horrible!,I look around at all these happy little families in their happy little homes, and I wonder, \Why can't that be me?\ Instead, I am trapped without any hope of ever becoming anything more than a whore. You see, I must not really be a wife to my husband; I'm just his whore!,Alright, since I commented on Jack's...\
\
You just woke up naked in bed next to me!\
Using only three words, what would you say to me?\
