When I was in children's ministry we always taught them to say, \Yay God,\ whenever God did something special - I think it is a very appropriate response in times when God so wonderfully fills up your car for a super fun road trip with people that you love!  \YAY GOD!\,He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.
