We have not had much sun up here today but it is not too bad, bit cool I think but the clouds are black so will expect thunder later no doubt. Have a great weekend.,wishing I was in my bed right now, so tired, neighbours had a party on Saturday which started at 3pm in the afternoon and went on until 3am Sunday morning, so did not get much sleep. zzzzz,yes for you that was pants!!,eat my dust !!,just watching the sun and wishing I was out in it.,Sick of this rain, we now have thunder, so much for Summer!!,sitting watching tv while off on holiday just now.  Been watching qvc for all the craft stuff, some amazing stuff and really good prices, If I had the money I would spend a fortune on this chanel.,Thanking God it is Friday, it has been a long week !!,wishing the weather was going to stay lovely like it is just now for all the weekend.,Wishing I could just put my head down and go to sleep zzzzzz,Watched Marley & Me the other day, good film and that is all I am going to say for those who have not watched it.
