Decorating is a bit like watching paint dry....,Roll on the weekend.....,shucks - the countdown to Monday morning.....,This time last week it was still yesterday!,Is feeling rather pleased with himself as he has just replaced his first ever radiator and there's no leaks! Buying all the kit (gloves, blow lamp, gas, solder, flux, copper pipe, copper elbows, pipe cutter etc) was still cheaper than getting a plumber in.
