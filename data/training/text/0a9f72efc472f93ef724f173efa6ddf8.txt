would like to say Thank you to all my Friends and Family that wished me Happy Birthday!! I had the BEST POSSIBLE Birthday I could have considering I spent almost 10 hours of it at BBY...thanks to my extended bby Family!!,finally starting to get my voice back :),enjoyed my 4...well 3 and 1/2 day weekend :)...tomorrow....back to work :(,looking forward to getting my hair done!!,is so Grateful for all my Friends and Family....and my extended at family BBY...Have a Wonderful Thanksgiving...to my BBY Fam....get your rest....we're going to need it!!,There comes a point in life when \fun\ no longer means bar hopping or drinking too much & staying out all night. It means playing Wii games, trips to the park, and bedtime stories. Sleeping in means maybe 8 am. Becoming a parent doesn't change you, its realizing that the little person you've made deserves the best of your free time! Re-post if YOU are PROUD to be a \boring\ responsible parent,Never let someone else determine what happiness is to you...#livelifelove,Hate
