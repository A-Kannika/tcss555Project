Is at the home and garden show...blah.,Yay for V.I.P I just got two guitar picks without having to fight for them lol,Fuuuuuuuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Dear Florida, \
I used to think I hated your flat, thunderstorm ridden ass...what with being full of assholes that can't drive and no discernible seasons. But, after my week in hell, I mean Maryland, I have come to terms with my hatred. I now embrace you as my home...at least until I can manage a move to New Orleans...\
Love,\
Tumblina,Spilled her coffee, broke a shoelace. Smeared the lipstick on her face...Slammed the door and said \"I'm sorry, I had a bad day again\"...,\"All the worlds a stage; and all its men and women merely players.\",It's really funny how all those songs that used to make me think of someone else make me think of you now...,I think I should've stayed in bed today...,All in all...it's just another brick in the wall...,\"Open foot, insert mouth...\",OMFG!!!!! Let the wild rumpus begin!,Crisis averted...perhaps I'm cut out for accounting afterall....,is so"
