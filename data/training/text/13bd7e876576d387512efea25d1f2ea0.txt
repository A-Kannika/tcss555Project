Michael Jackson...,Man im chillin in my cave like batman, and im strong for my age like bam-bam...--song goes hard...,The BET Awards was amazing, you shoulda tuned in...prolly the greatest awards show i have ever seen...too many great performers, not enough time...damn i need a ticket to that joint...,If your not hopping on...move out my way...,Cant wait to watch Vick play 2moro....i dont know why everyone hatin on him...yall jus out of your mind...,Usain bolt is a god....and he is officially my favorite athlete of 2009....  9.58,Woke up @ 420...We jus finished our 5am workout....and to let yall into our lives...we just ran 55+ 100meter sprints back-to-back with no rest...,But UH!, the things i could do ta her...I wish i could have a threesome wit 2 of her.... I would sing a love song if i knew the words, but i be damned if another nigga do it first
