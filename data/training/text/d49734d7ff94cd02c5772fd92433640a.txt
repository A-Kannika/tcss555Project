I would like to see Lesnar fight Hong Man Choi because he's so big --- I guess it was set for 2007 then they cancelled it because Hong Man Choi has tumor on his pituitary gland - now he's a rap artist in South Korea...very big man - huge - seems like a ni,Frank Mir is a true class act ....,Can anybody explain this?: My little dog, which I adopted from the Long Beach Shelter, has what appears to be a tattoo in the groin area...its a perfect line about an 3/4 inch, black/dark blue ink, look like a 7-9 mag round tattoo needle width...who would do this to a dog? Is there any reason or meaning? Maybe his previous owner was testing out tattoo guns on him? It seems really strange.,THANKS ERICKA YOU GUYS ARE SOOO FUN
