preparing for monday classes,i dont have one...,Don't ever forget that it is best to listen much,speak little,and not become angry;Listen to advice and accept instruction,and in the end you will be wise.Pay attention and listen to the sayings of the wise;apply your heart to what i teach,for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and all of them ready on your lips.,In everything i did, I showed you that by this kind of hardwork we must help the weak,remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.',Everyone can make you smile,but only certain people can make you happy...,Those who didn't make it,maybe the lord doesn't want them to be a part of a dirty politics...,BE A DOER OF GOD'S WORD
