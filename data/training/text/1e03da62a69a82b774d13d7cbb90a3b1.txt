- sam is the bestest step daughter ever,Hey all! I need nails & wooden boards for my horse stable. Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you! (-:,There's 3 parts to the song below from bottom to top, click on \show similar posts\.,We met in a farm, Shared the lines in my head, Told me we're strong, Will always belong, Is that what you meant? You had plans for both of us, That involved a trip outta town. To a place I'd seen, On an Acer screen, A place that I'd sought & found. I don't have you with me, I try n keep good attitude. Do you miss me? Miss misery like you say you do?,Can anyone out there tell me why some people lie & decieve? Promise the world then hurt you? It would pay in my life to become like them, become a prick. Maybe I'd get somewhere. Maybe I'd get respect.,I'll fake it through the day, With some help from Dr Jack instead. Send the poison rain, Down the drain, To numb bad thoughts in my head. A heart that's torn in half, Thoughts of one, All only you. Do you miss me? Miss misery like you
