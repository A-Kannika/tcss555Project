board talk to me,board does anyone wanna hang today,board someone talk to me,talk to me,bored talk to me!,bored,im goin to be honest i am bored,Does not feel like goin to work today,baby sitting all night bored,slept till 2 we probably making today a chill day,at wildwood, fun night,does anyone know anywhere thats hiring,Realize the sun doesn't go down, it's just an illusion caused by the  world spinning round. Best flaming lips lyrics ever,bored talk to me,bored as hell talk to me,bored baby sitting till 4 then stll have to go to school this sucks,there is never anyting to do in levittown,back from my vacation,hanging with the wifie after school, then we going to gym,just got off work, working 5 to 10 tomorrow,Where is my Mind the song to my life.,just got off work so tired,\Weep for yourself, my man, \
\
you'll never be what is in your heart\
\
weep little lion man, \
\
you're not as brave as you were at the start\
\
rate yourself and rake yourself, \
\
take all the courage you have left\
\
wasted on fixing all the pro"
