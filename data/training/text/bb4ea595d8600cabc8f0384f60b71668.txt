Gonna take a break from writing... thinking of buying a speech to text program... a lazy man's way to creating a novel.,Had fun with Josie and Landon at dinner... Landon kept trying to give me \bite bite\... ended up with chocolate on my white shirt from his little hands, little but still warm enough to melt a hershey kiss. He is so freaking cute! Josie definetly has my personality... hand on hip, hand palm up and over the top explainations... I was rolling!!!,Why did I have to suggest covering the halls with blankets and sheets for bedtime??? Nic and Laney officially wore me out tonight! Thankfully I talked them out of our little adventure with swearing to do it next time I come over for the night. Of course, Laney had to check for no crossies. :: mischievious grin :: Smart girl!! Dreamland looks promising... :: yawns and drifts off to sleep ::,I wish everyone shared the way of thinking Ashley and I have... the world would be a happier place... To the two that have found their exit, and to the one trying to,
