Broken not understanding why :-(,Fellin better about a lot of things..... Still don't have a clue what to do about the car.... I will figure it out I guess,Heart broken and I dont understand why,Light up your face with gladness, Hide every trace of sadness, Although a tear may be ever so near, That's the time you must keep on trying, Smile, what's the use of crying?  You'll find that life is still worthwhile, If you just smile,:-( Cant Sleep..... Wish I could just lay down and sleep :-(,Well FB I guess I shoud try to get some sleep... Although I dont know how much selep I will get I should at least try.,Smile though your heart is aching, Smile even though it's breaking, When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by, If you smile through your fear and sorrow, Smile and maybe tomorrow, You'll see the sun come shining through for you,To all you mommies out there,join the fun and re-post this. How much did your child(ren) weigh at birth?..... Rylan was 8lbs. 13oz :-) .,Should have my phone back on today...... L
