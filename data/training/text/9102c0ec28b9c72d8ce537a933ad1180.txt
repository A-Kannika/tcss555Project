Man, it does not feel like its only 11:33 here. It feels almost like 2 or something. I have so much stuff to do tomorrow but I have only one class so its all homework and errands I need to do. :( Boring stuff, really. Oh, I am going to my roommates, Nessa's, house this weekend !! :) I have yet to leave this 2-3 mile block since I have been here. (Expect for the time I went to Pit. for the Clipper, doesn't count) ;),Just got back from a long walk around campus. I also had a nice long one-side conversation with the big man himself. At least I hope He was listening or people will start to think that I'am weiod or something. I really should go to bed. Ahuu . . . Night all.,Lauren Yost Well some how, when my computer rebuted, I got everything back including my music and whatnot. But I am praying that it doesnt happen again.
