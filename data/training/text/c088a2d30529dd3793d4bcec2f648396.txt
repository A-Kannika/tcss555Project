Time isn't holding us. Time isn't after us. Same as it ever was. Same as it ever was. I feel a twister coming. Here comes the twister.,now the war is won. how come nothing tastes good?,I have dreams of orca whales and owls, but I wake up in fear.,\and I can't help but feel all touched by the feelings i can't even match, with my face pressed up to the glass wanting you\- Smashing Pumpkins,This is one for the good days. I have 'em all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue green. No matter what happens now, I won't be afraid because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen.,while laughing up a storm, until we were just bone. until it got so warm that nbone of us could sleep.,miss you,I don't want to be your friend. I just want to be you lover no matter how it ends, no matter how it starts. Forget about your house of cards, and I'll deal mine. Fall off the table and get swept under. Denial.,Sleeping is giving in, no matter what the time is. Sleeping is giving in, so lift those heavey eyelids.,Ji
