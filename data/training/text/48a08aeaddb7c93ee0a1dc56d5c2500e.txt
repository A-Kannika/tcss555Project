Come to me, but not for me.,Another day another night inside a lonely world\
Another game another fight inside a lonely world\
Another wrong another right inside a lonely world\
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world\
No matter how hard i can try inside a lonely world\
No one can hear me when i cry inside a lonely world\
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world\
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world,I feel the reason as its leaving me no not again,What do I have to do?\
Why can't this hurt be through?\
I'm going head-on to something\
I know I will fail\
Why can't this kiss be true?\
Why won't you please let me through?\
I don't understand why you always push me away,Some deny and search for things that never come around\
Do I feel like a fool?\
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared\
And I owe this all to you\
\
I'm feeling like I'm sinking\
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing"
