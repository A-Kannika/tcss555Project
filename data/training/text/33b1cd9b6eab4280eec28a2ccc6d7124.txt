Made it home from taking Ellen to the dentist just in time to get the convertible in the carport before the monsoon hit. whew!!,Finished \Breakfast with Buddha\ yesterday. thank you so much Brigitte. This was fabulous. I highly recommend it to all who seek happiness.,I can't remember the last time I was on FB. Missing E,Mocha might be a little bit better today. Thank God. Ellen is off the wall anyway.,9 days since ellen quit smokng and there are actually moments of the old ellen back. Even she is now mad at cigarettes for having such a hold on her. Yeah baby..,Wishing a Happy Birthday to my little brother Art. Wow you got old. What's happening in paradise?,Day 5 nearly done (since E stopped smoking) OMG. I think it was easier for me to quit.,now I'm blowing and sneezing all day.,Vegas was wonderful. 20 degrees warmer and the sun is strong and bright. I love the desert.,I just wanted to thank all of our friends for your love and support as Ellen recuperates. She is doing fine but in a good bit of pain. So, nee
