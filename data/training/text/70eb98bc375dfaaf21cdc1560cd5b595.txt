It was here that Telugu was given grammar and a script by the poet Nannayya, without which it could not have been termed as a language.-wiki..It is COOL isnt it!!!,i don't believe it myself but i kinda want to go back to college!!,whenever i get nervous, either i talk a lot or laugh for no apparent reason and nowadays i do them both!!!,all the apprehension and wait was worth it...way to go sreeram...love you...:-),just watched khaleja...i dont understand whats with mahesh...first he plays a taxidriver and then a GOD!!! and ultra rich ppl still use swords and knifes to kill when they can just hire snipers...but the movie was alrite..can watch it once..
