Okay so, I kinda miss you... Like a lot.,A little motivation pain doesn't tell you when you ought to stop. Pain is the little voice in the back of you head that tries to hold you back because it knows if you continue, you will change. Don't let it stop you from being who you can be. Exhaustion tells you when you ought to stop. You only reach your limit when you can go no further.,I like who I am and I don't feel I need to impress anyone.,Nice weather always brings my mood up. I think I shall take advantage of it. : ),You know you're inlove when reality has finally become better than your dreams.,Hmm... Like this status and i'll post my favourite memory of us on your wall.... : ),Who's still awake and wants an inbox? : )
