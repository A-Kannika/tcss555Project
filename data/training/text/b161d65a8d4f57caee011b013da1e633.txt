Just woke up at 2 then realized i gotta work at 330 so that should be fun. Going after work to grab decorations Then probably going back to sleep. : ),Your crystal eyes loked at me; silently staring and i realized you could be broken apart too.,Waiting till tomorrow, wondering when I'll wake up and realize everything with you was just a dream...................,Rearranging my room, being forced to. Then working on stuff for party. Don't know what i'm doing later maybe having Amber cut my hair :) Otherwize i got a very laid back day on my hands...........,Getting ready for Grad party. Setting up tonight then more crap tomorrow morning. i would rather be at work now, even with the produce sale going on, and the sandwichs and ice cream, and mochas. at least i would know what to do with everything then and wo,Grad party was pretty cool. : ) i had alot of fun. cleanup went fast and now i just gotta see if i can get something called a license...........im really sick of hearing about it.,Never mind plans change.
