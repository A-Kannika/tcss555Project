Wendell and I wish you a very happy anniversary!!!!!,I loved your pictures of your visit to Californina Adventure.,When Kevin was little, I took him to the doctor and the doctor gave us a prescription, Kevin looked at it and aksed the doctor if they were taught to write that bad in medical school.  The doctor told Kevin, they had to write very fast and they continued ,Was it windy, it could be windburn.,Have a great anniversary on Saturday!!!!!,We have been married for 43 years and I was 21 when we married and Wendell was 23.  I think we might have been a little on the young side, but I would do it all again.,Happy Thanksgiving to all!  I have the best family in the world!,Happy Birthday to our wonderful Marlena!!!!!,Happy New Year everyone.,I hope you are writing all this down and will show it to her when she is a big girl.,I saw the retina specialist today and he thinks my eye is doing very well.  He removed more sutures.  I asked how many sutures remain in the eye and he said I still have 12 to be removed.
