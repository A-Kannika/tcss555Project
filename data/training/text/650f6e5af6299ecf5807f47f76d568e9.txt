Now just take care of errands, donate plasma and take a nap and I will be ready to party it up tonight.,Currently taking an AutoCAD short course and actually enjoying it some.,The computers in the Civil Engineering lab are driving me crazy right now.,I just got done goofing off at the computer lab and I'm about to donate plasma before I go to karate practice...I know so safe.,I had a great weekend, I hope this carries through over the week.,I just had a senior project presentation and geotech exam today and I still have a bunch of crap t
