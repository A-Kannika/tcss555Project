is bored,sleep starved.....,Its been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship.These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday,regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live, and they don't hold grudges.They understand that life is busy..but you will ALWAYS love them...Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends, they will know who they are...,My mom and dad hv Made me laugh ....Wiped my tears .....Hugged me tight.....Watched me succeed.....Seen me fall.....Cheered me on.....Kept me going strong.....And.....Drove me a little crazy at times .....But parents are a promise from God that you will have two friends forever!! Put this on your status if you've got a wonderful mom and dad who you love !! . . ?? love u dad n mom :),\Yeh kis pyaari hifaazat main ho befikrii kii haalat hai,\
badi mazabut baahon main ho suraj ki hararat hai,\
tumhare vaaste tufaan sehlein muskuraon tum,\
jiyo har lamha tumko zindagi pine kii aa"
