\Finally Free\,Things are never what they seem....In my life at least.,Merry Christmas Everyone!!!,Happy New Year....Yall be safe.,This is such a boring Saturday night....Somebody save me from this boredom.,Had so much fun last night that I just woke up and still got a hangover.,We never know when our last days are near....So make sure you tell the people that you love....That you love them everyday....Cause you might not get the chance to tell them tomorrow.,They say when one door closes, another one opens....But I'm anticipating going through this new door....I'm scared of where it might take me.,Lots of unexpected things have happened to me this year. People that I thought would be in my life forever prove to me that they were not worthy to be in my life, and people that I thought would never be in my life came into my life and help me in so many ways.This year has been a crazy, but I wouldn't change it. I want to thank GOD for my friends who has been there for me this year .I Love you Guys.Happy New Years
