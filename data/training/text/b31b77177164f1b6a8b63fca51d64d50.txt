Heard on a CST-Karjat local.. \Nokia battery.. ekdum original.. sirf pachchas rupye\.. Yours truly inspects one and finds it complete with a hologram. :) Love Mumbai!!!,Shifted base to good old Mumbai. New phase begins here on 26th April. :),All said and done, Sachin R. Tendulkar played for his side in the finals with five stitches on his right hand and still stood the top scorer for Mumbai. Couldnt even shake hands during the awards ceremony. What an indomitable spirit!! A salute to the Gladiator of our times... Hail Tendlya!!!,\I have wrestled with an alligator.. done tussle with a whale, handcuffed lightning, throw thunder in jail... Only last week I murdered a rock, injured a stone... hospitalized a brick.. I am so bad I make medicines sick...\ :)
