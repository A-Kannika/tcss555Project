would like to swing on a star...instead of rotating tires.,wishes her Netflix was coming today.  :(,has two retarded cats.  Spooky and Earl are currently lounging in a wheelbarrow full of dirt.,'s babies left her a dead present in bed and four more in the kitchen.  I'm so proud.,is giving blood in about an hour.,has overdosed on salad and veggies.  Oh, and a side of cottage cheese.,has an appt to give blood on August 3rd at St Luke's in Woodburn.  Think about giving blood.  It is an easy thing to do.,has a date with a hot bath and the end of a short story I haven't read in years.,probably won't get to see her new neice because her daddy is going to hold her hostage in Germany to make sure my sister goes back.  Anyone know anyone in Germany willing to kidnap my sister and her kids so she can visit?  Dad is going downhill fast and this may be his only chance to see his only granddaughter.,is taking a break from painting the kitchen.,will miss her $400 Jetta.  It has gone to the great scrap yard in the sky.  Jus
