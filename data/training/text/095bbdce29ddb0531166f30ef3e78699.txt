Breathing in, breathing out I'm gasping for breath. - Raining and OK, Empty Handed,Going to Summer in the Son... 5 bags, my sleeping bag and pillow... I am set!!!!,Listening to instrumentals.,Listening to/Watching Stevie Wonder on T.V. He is legend, man!!!!!!,My hair smells like chocolate chip cookies...,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. ?,Why is it that in our society, people will change things about themselves just to fit in and be liked?,Why am I listening to Christmas music in the middle of June?,Again, with the 80's music...,Cause I'm only as tall, as my heart will let me be...,SWEDISH FISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Downloading LOTS of music! I'm talking like a list of hundreds of songs here!! This is one of my favorite activities though so YAY!!!!!!!!,I guess Kevin Jonas can't stand to be a virgin anymore... He's getting married...
