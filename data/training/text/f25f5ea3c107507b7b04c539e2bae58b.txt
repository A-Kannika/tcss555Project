Thanks to all of you for the birthday wishes!!,Heard Spinal Tap's \Big Bottom\ on the radio tonight. Totally uplifted me.\
\"I met her on Monday, 'twas my lucky bun day . . .\",still hates mayonnaise.,Looking for polenta tips. Made some for the first time last night, but the results were rather bland, which I suppose was to be expected considering the minimal recipe I used.,A major duck crossing delayed the last block of my drive home today. Their numbers are growing daily it seems. Last month I'd see ten at most crossing my street at a time. This morning there were 37 crossing together."
