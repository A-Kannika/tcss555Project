\Som malicky kamienok na obrovskom strkovisku, a predsa sa citim vynimocne.\,Though my soul may set in darkness, \
it will rise in perfect light, \
I have loved the stars too fondly\
to be fearful of the night.,Nesud nikoho, ak si predtym aspom hodinu nekracal v jeho topankach.,All that is gold does not glitter, \
not all those who wander are lost;\
the old that is strong does not wither, \
deep roots are not reached by the frost.\
From the ashes a fire shall be woken, \
a light from the shadows shall spring;\
renewed shall be blade that was broken,\
the crownless again shall be king.,Night time is really the best time to work. All the ideas are there to be yours because everyone else is asleep. :-),Must I surrender my soul to the darkest of knights,\
am I that dove, on his floor cut short of its flight?\
Can you tell me why I feel like this,\
be the one to explain, why I'm not at peace.\
As I wander lost in this darkened hall\
as I hope for light, from an open door.,Ak si v spolocnosti zeny a chces z nej citat ako z knihy,"
