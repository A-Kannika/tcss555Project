Insomnia: it sucks. Just sayin'.,I think I'm sick... my stomach and head feel like shit... gotta sleep it off.,Food, rope, plastic, clothes, medicine. Someone tell me the common link between all of these, barring money.,So, my D&D group type people. My DM for my other game is sick, so I'm wondering if anyone has time this week to get together and just do a purely roleplay session, as well as me handing out gear.,You've been hacked my love <3\
I LOVE YOU!,Being sick is no fun.,woke up like seven times this morning.,Facebook. Goodnight. Yeah.,No one is online... gasp!,So, won't be able to make it out tomorrow seeing as how my cousin is leaving the day after. Sorry, I just found this out, so I'm telling you now.,Saw a three-day novel ad, and really wanna do it. Really hate being poor/not having a job sometimes.,Darkness only holds sway until the light shines upon it.,So very tired... must try to sleep at regular times sometime eventually maybe.,Sleep evades me at this late hour... maybe I'll play Bowser's Inside "
