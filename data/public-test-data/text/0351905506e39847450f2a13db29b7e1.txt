Maybe   \soon\,..that i miss you baby..i realize, it was just my mind played tricks on me,Absence makes the heart grow fonder,Every time i miss you...I cry out for you... wishing to find you beside me saying here i am baby..but i hear nothing just the echo of my voice,Thought i heared your voice yesterday..when i turned around to say that i miss you baby.. i found nothing and it's just my mind playing tricks on me,Dying without you,If one day... my heart tried to remember me ...with any memory had linked us together...I will make it stop beating forever,How many times i turned to talk to you ,kiss you even cry on your shoulder and found you not there...,I wish... i can always find you ....whenever i feel that i need you ... But this will always be just... a wish,I will always remember... every word we said...everything we did...the time we were together...untill i breathe my last.,If oneday...you heard that i died...you must know that...i was always thinking about you,crying out for you every single night whe
