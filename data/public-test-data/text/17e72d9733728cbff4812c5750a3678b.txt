is off for his typical Wednesday night meeting with his best friend for dinner and dancing. It's a bit overcast, but an otherwise perfect occasion for me to walk to dinner through the streets of my great city, Chicago.,Decisions, decisions. Do I stay in and go to sleep early to be well-rested for a 15 mile run tomorrow morning? Or do I go out tonight and shake that groove thing, shake that groove thing, yeah, yeah? Argh, common sense is telling me to stay in and rest. W,Was feeling a bit sad due to the often cruel world of dating. Then during my daily run, this old guy said to me, \You look great. Keep up the good work.\ I thought, \He's absolutely right.\ I look (and feel) better than I ever have, and all I have to do i,ran 17 miles today in under 3 hours, but is left wondering how in the hell I'll be able to do 26.2 miles with \only\ about 2 months of training left before M-Day. I'll hit the neighborhood bars in Rogers Park tonight to find out if the locals have any answers :),feels great after running 19 m
