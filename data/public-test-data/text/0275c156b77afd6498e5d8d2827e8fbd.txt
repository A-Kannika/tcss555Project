finally has a job. yayness.,had a good time today and is looking forward to monday &hearts;,wonders why some people chose to feel miserable when they are lucky to be alive and have a roof over their heads,is going to make it through it,is all alone. no one is there to comfort her in anything. :( fml,feels apprehensive,they took away my internet access because i downloaded copyrighted material :'(,is missing you &hearts;,Sometime I wish someone would take me far away from this place :(,Why do I let people suck the life out of me and make me very unhappy while they couldn't care less about me? It is time for me to put my happiness first.,wishes deleting you from my memory was as easy as deleting something on facebook,feels much better thanks to Blake Walton opening my eyes a little,love is the best drug ever until you realize the other person won't ever feel the same way,it is often the desire of instant gratification that causes problems in my life :(,is excited to go to the pub tonight :D,\overthinking... ove
