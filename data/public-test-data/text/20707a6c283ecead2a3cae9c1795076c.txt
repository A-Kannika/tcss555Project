FlirTatIoN: atTenTioN wIthOuT IntenTioN,On the keyboard of life, always keep one finger on the Escape key..!!!,If I live to be a hundred n never see the seven wonders\
That'll be alright.!\
If I don't make it to the big leagues n never win a praise\
I'm gonna be just fine.!\
\
Coz I know exactly who I am..\
I'm my papa's daughter, I'm my jiju's n di's darling n when the day's done, my momma's still my biggest fan..\
Sometimes, I'm clueless but I've got friends n cousins that love me.!\
They know just where I stand n thats who I am.,I wasn't born a princess..\
BUT IF THE CROWN FITS..? :P,She was looking for love.. He was looking for fun\
Yeah, boys n mascara always run... :(  :'( \

I'm a part of you indefinitely..\
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me,\
Ooh darling coz you'll always be my baby..!,THIS IS THE BEST FEELING...\
This INNOCENCE is brilliant..!!,The average woman would rather have beauty than brains, because the average man can see better than he can think.,When you walk away"
