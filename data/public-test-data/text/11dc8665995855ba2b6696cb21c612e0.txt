begining the long process of editing 150 photos from a glorious weekend honoring the new Mr. and Mrs. Gilkey,tired...... but finaly done with wedding weekend pictures,needs more poeple for fantasy football,a week or so ago their was a post on facebook by my account that talked about whitening strips and used some foul language. I posted then that it was not me that did it but it has gotten back to me that some people did not get that. Now anyone who really knows me should already know it wasnt me and I don't know why I have to say it again, but aparently I do because people are still spreading false rumors about it.,is a Christian and proud to say it! Let's see how many people on facebook aren't afraid to show their love for God!! Repost this as your status. The catch is each time you see this on someone's status say a quick prayer for the person who posted it. God bless!!!,Rebellion cancelled tonight. Chilling at Ashland Coffee ans Tea listening to tunes and doing school stuff.,Google won't search for Chuck
