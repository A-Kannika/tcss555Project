U2 still haven't found what they were looking for ....... I found something I wasn't looking for, I found more. It makes me feel like Chris de Burgh when, high on emotion, he sang: \Oh, my heart is spinning like a wheel and only she can see the way that I feel\ and Amanda moved Don Williams to sing that she was the light of his life.
