\What but design of darkness to appall?-- If design govern in a thing so small. \,Just finished a 22 mile bike ride and is somewhat tired.,Has moved into his new dorm,Is heading back to Urbana,\I have a secret place inside my mind, where I keep hidden inspiration you won't find.\,reality came crashing to wake me from my reverie.,\Catch-22 did not exist, he was positive of that, but it made no difference. What did matter was that everyone thought it existed, and that was much worse, for there was no object or text to ridicule or refute, to accuse, criticize, attack, amend, hate, revile, spit at, rip to shreads, trample upon or burn up.\,What a downpour,I don't feel a thing and I stopped remembering The days are just like moments turned to hours,Test 1 of 4 for the week done.,Test 2/4 complete.   Friday is going to suck.,This week is finally over. Praise the FSM,It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring. -Carl Sagan,Heat of destruction,
